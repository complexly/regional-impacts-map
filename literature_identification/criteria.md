# Inclusion criteria

Include documents that relate broadly to the detection and attribution of the
impacts of climate change

## Attribution

Mark whether the document relates to

- **Climate Attribution**: The link between greenhouse gas or aerosol emissions
and climate-related forcings
- **Climate Impact Attribution**: The impacts of long-term changes in climate-related
forcings on natural and human systems beyond a specified baseline which characterizes its behaviour
in the absence of climate change
- **Weather sensitivity**: The response of a system to fluctuations in weather including individual weather extremes
- **Impact event attribution**: The effects of individual weather extremes on natural
or human systems (e.g. 'was the reported occurence of cholera triggered by an associated flood event')
- **Climate event attribution**: The attribution of individual climateic extreme events to greenhouse
gas and aerosol emissions



#### Detection

Research that identifies whether a natural or human system is changing beyond a specified baseline because of climate change

### Attribution


## Weather sensitivity
- response of system to fluctuations in weather, including individual weather extremes

### Impact event attribution
- The effects of individual weather extremes

If a specific climate event can be
- attributed to climate change
- identified as a driver of observed changes in natural or human systems
then these changes can also be attributed to long-term anthropogenic climate change


## Counterfactuals
Counterfactuals are simulated by process-based or empirical modelling
- **type 1**: explicit accounting for non-climate drivers
- **type 2**: implicit accounting for non-climate drivers
- **type 3**: exclusion of non-climate drivers
