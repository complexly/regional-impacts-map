If, as anticipated, they dry this century, they might accelerate climate change through carbon losses and changed surface energy balances. We used records from multiple long-term monitoring plots across Amazonia to assess forest responses to the intense 2005 drought, a possible analog of future events. Affected forest lost biomass, reversing a large long-term carbon sink, with the greatest impacts observed where the dry season was unusually intense. Relative to pre-2005 conditions, forest subjected to a 100-millimeter increase in water deficit lost 5.3 megagrams of aboveground biomass of carbon per hectare. The drought had a total biomass carbon impact of 1.2 to 1.6 petagrams (1.2 \u00d7 1015 to 1.6 \u00d7 1015 grams). Amazon forests therefore appear vulnerable to increasing moisture stress, with the potential for large carbon losses to exert feedback on climate change.", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Phillips2009"}, {"year": "2010", "url": "http://193.194.138.236/pdf/supporting-material/uncertainty-guidance-note.pdf", "title": "{Guidance notes for lead authors of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report on consistent treatment of uncertainties}", "publisher": "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Geneva, Switzerland", "pages": "5", "keywords": "adaptation,climate change science,mitigation", "file": "::", "author": "Mastrandrea, M D and Field, C B and Stocker, T F and Edenhofer, O and Ebi, K L and Frame, D J and Held, H and Kriegler, E and Mach, K J and Matschoss, P R and Plattner, G K and Yohe, G W and Zwiers, F W", "ENTRYTYPE": "techreport", "ID": "Mastrandrea2010"}, {"year": "2008", "volume": "35", "title": "{Climate warming and related changes in Mediterranean marine biota}", "pages": "5--21", "journal": "CIESM Workshop Monographs", "author": "Boero, F and F{\\'{e}}ral, J P and Azzurro, E and Cardin, V and Riedel, B and Despalatovi{\\'{c}}, Marija and Munda, I and Moschella, P and Zaouali, J and {Fonda Umani}, S", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Boero2008"}, {"year": "2008", "url": "http://site.ebrary.com/lib/stanford/Doc?id=10199687", "title": "{Climate variability and the global harvest: impacts of El Ni{\\textcopyright}{\\l}o and other oscillations on agroecosystems}", "publisher": "Oxford University Press", "pages": "259", "keywords": "Climate and civilization,Climatic changes,Crops and climate,El Ni{\\textcopyright}{\\l}o Current,Forecasting", "isbn": "0195137639; 9780195137637", "author": "Rosenzweig, Cynthia and Hillel, Daniel", "annote": "{\\textless}m:note{\\textgreater}Cynthia Rosenzweig, Daniel Hillel.; Includes bibliographical references (p. 209-245) and index.{\\textless}m:linebreak/{\\textgreater}        {\\textless}m:linebreak/{\\textgreater}S600.7.C54 R673 2008{\\textless}/m:note{\\textgreater}", "address": "Oxford ; New York", "ENTRYTYPE": "book", "ID": "Rosenzweig2008a"}, {"year": "2012", "title": "{Climate Change, environment and Migration in the Sahel}", "number": "1", "journal": "Selected issues with a focus on Senegal and Mali.Migration, Climate and Environment", "author": "Hummel, D and Doevenspeck, M and Samimi, C", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Hummel2012"}, {"year": "2007", "volume": "112", "title": "{Glacio-isostatic deformation around the Vatnaj{\\~{A}}{\\P}kull ice cap, Iceland, induced by recent climate warming: GPS observations and finite element modeling}", "number": "8", "journal": "J.geophys.Res", "author": "Pagli, C and Sigmundsson, F and Lund, B and Sturkell, E and Geirsson, H and Einarsson, P and {\\~{A}}\u0081rnad{\\~{A}}\u00b3ttir, T and Hreinsd{\\~{A}}\u00b3ttir, S", "annote": "ID: 3517", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Pagli2007"}, {"year": "2007", "url": "http://mhj.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/10/1-2/75", "title": "{The Great El Nino of 1789 93 and its Global Consequences: Reconstructing an an Extreme Climate Event in World Environmental History}", "month": "jan", "journal": "The Medieval History Journal", "author": "Grove, R", "abstract": "of the 1788--93/94 event did not strike Mexico until 1793, so that the onset of full El Ni{\\{}$\\backslash${\\~{}}n{\\}}o conditions did not 26 Further caused crop failures also took place in the summers of 1808--11, bring- ing about a wholesale The Medieval History Journal, 10, 1{\\{}$\\backslash${\\&}{\\}}2 (2007): 75--986", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Grove2007"}, {"year": "2010", "title": "{Australian agriculture in a climate of change.}", "publisher": "CSIRO Publishing,", "pages": "101--111", "editor": "Jubb, I and Holper, P and Cai, W", "booktitle": "Managing Climate Change: Papers from the GREENHOUSE 2009 Conference", "author": "Howden, S M and Crimp, S J and Nelson, R", "address": "Collingwood, Australia", "ENTRYTYPE": "incollection", "ID": "Howden2010"}, {"year": "2007", "volume": "Davos, Swi", "title": "{Climate Change and Tourism\u2013Responding to Global Challenges}", "pages": "256", "booktitle": "2nd International Conference on Climate Change and Tourism.

Recent in situ observations have suggested that larch-dominated taiga and permafrost behave as a coupled eco-climate system across a broad boreal zone of Siberia. However, neither field-based observations nor modeling experiments have clarified the synthesized dynamics of this system. Here, using a new dynamic vegetation model coupled with a permafrost model, we reveal the processes of interaction between the taiga and permafrost. The model demonstrates that under the present climate conditions in eastern Siberia, larch trees maintain permafrost by controlling the seasonal thawing of permafrost, which in turn maintains the taiga by providing sufficient water to the larch trees. The experiment without permafrost processes showed that larch would decrease in biomass and be replaced by a dominance of pine and other species that suffer drier hydroclimatic conditions. In the coupled system, fire not only plays a destructive role in the forest, but also, in some cases, preserves larch domination in forests. Climate warming sensitivity experiments show that this coupled system cannot be maintained under warming of about 2 degrees C or more. Under such conditions, a forest with typical boreal tree species (dark conifer and deciduous species) would become dominant, decoupled from the permafrost processes. This study thus suggests that future global warming could drastically alter the larch-dominated taiga-permafrost coupled system in Siberia, with associated changes of WEC processes and feedback to climate.", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Zhang"}, {"year": "2012", "title": "{Destruction, Disinvestment, and Death: Economic and Human Losses Following Environmental Disaster}", "journal": "NBER Working paper series", "author": "Anttila-Hughes, Jesse K and Hsiang, Solomon M", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Anttila-Hughes2012"}, {"year": "2010", "volume": "21", "url": "http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-78650432650{\\&}partnerID=40{\\&}md5=c4d5b294424634b7abe5eaf6be0adc89", "title": "{A lump of coal, a bunch of grapes}", "pages": "107--111", "number": "2", "journal": "Journal of Wine Research", "author": "Smart, R E", "address": "Honorary Research Associate, School of Agricultural Science, University of Tasmania, Launceston, Australia", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Smart2010"}, {"year": "2013", "title": "{Coastal Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerabilities: A Technical Input to the 2013 National Climate Assessment}", "publisher": "Island Press", "pages": "216", "author": "Burkett, Virginia and Davidson, M A", "address": "Washington DC, USA", "ENTRYTYPE": "book", "ID": "Burkett2013"}, {"year": "2013", "title": "{Resilience of international policies to changing social-ecological systems: Arctic shipping in the Bering Strait}", "publisher": "Arctic Council, Stockholm Environment Institute and Stockholm Resilience Centre", "pages": "99--104", "booktitle": "Arctic Resilience Interim Report", "author": "Robards, M", "address": "Stockholm, Sweden", "ENTRYTYPE": "incollection", "ID": "Robards2013"}, {"year": "2006", "volume": "35", "title": "{Forest carbon management in the United States}", "publisher": "American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, Soil Science Society", "pages": "1461--1469", "number": "4", "journal": "Journal of Environmental Quality", "author": "Birdsey, Richard and Pregitzer, Kurt and Lucier, Alan", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Birdsey2006"}, {"year": "2007", "url": "http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic470466.files/Commodity Price Shocks and Civil Conflict {\\_} Evidence from Colombia{\\_}Oeindrila Dube{\\_}October 08.pdf", "title": "{Commodity price shocks and civil conflict: Evidence from Colombia}", "month": "jan", "booktitle": "Working Paper", "author": "Dube, O and Vargas, J", "abstract": "Measures of other municipal characteristics, including population, rainfall and temperature are obtained from the player in the world coffee mar{\\{}$\\backslash${\\&}{\\}} ket, and its coffee may have Urdinola (2006) independently developed a similar measure of coffee price in Colombia.", "ENTRYTYPE": "techreport", "ID": "Dube2007"}, {"year": "2009", "url": "www.bom.gov.au/climate/current/statements/scs17d.pdf", "title": "{The exceptional January-February 2009 Heatwave in South-Eastern Australia}", "publisher": "National Climate Centre, Bureau of Meteorology", "author": "BOM", "address": "Canberra", "ENTRYTYPE": "misc", "ID": "BOM2009"}, {"year": "2011", "volume": "24", "title": "{The role of human activity in the recent warming of extremely warm daytime temperatures}", "pages": "1922--1930", "number": "7", "journal": "Journal of Climate", "author": "Christidis, Nikolaos and Stott, Peter A and Brown, Simon J", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Christidis2011"}, {"year": "2013", "title": "{Water Resources.

When CO 2 levels reached \u223c340 ppm, sporadic but highly destructive mass bleaching occurred in most reefs world-wide, often associated with El Ni{\\~{n}}o events. Recovery was dependent on the vulnerability of individual reef areas and on the reef's previous history and resilience. At today's level of \u223c387 ppm, allowing a lag-time of 10 years for sea temperatures to respond, most reefs world-wide are committed to an irreversible decline. Mass bleaching will in future become annual, departing from the 4 to 7 years return-time of El Ni{\\~{n}}o events. Bleaching will be exacerbated by the effects of degraded water-quality and increased severe weather events. In addition, the progressive onset of ocean acidification will cause reduction of coral growth and retardation of the growth of high magnesium calcite-secreting coralline algae. If CO 2 levels are allowed to reach 450 ppm (due to occur by 2030\u20132040 at the current rates), reefs will be in rapid and terminal decline world-wide from multiple synergies arising from mass bleaching, ocean acidification, and other environmental impacts. Damage to shallow reef communities will become extensive with consequent reduction of biodiversity followed by extinctions. Reefs will cease to be large-scale nursery grounds for fish and will cease to have most of their current value to humanity. There will be knock-on effects to ecosystems associated with reefs, and to other pelagic and benthic ecosystems. Should CO 2 levels reach 600 ppm reefs will be eroding geological structures with populations of surviving biota restricted to refuges. Domino effects will follow, affecting many other marine ecosystems. This is likely to have been the path of great mass extinctions of the past, adding to the case that anthropogenic CO 2 emissions could trigger the Earth's sixth mass extinction.", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Veron2009"}, {"year": "2007", "title": "{Inter-agency real-time evaluation of the response to the February 2007 floods and cyclone in Mozambique}", "publisher": "Inter-Agency Humanitarian Standing Committee", "pages": "91", "author": "Cosgrave, J and Goncalves, C and Martyris, D and Polastro, R and Sikumba-Dils, M", "annote": "http://www.unicef.org/evaldatabase/files/MOZ$\\backslash${\\_}RTE$\\backslash${\\_}2007$\\backslash${\\_}Floodsandcyclone.pdf", "address": "http://www.unicef.org/evaldatabase/files/MOZ{\\_}RTE{\\_}2007{\\_}Floodsandcyclone.pdf", "ENTRYTYPE": "techreport", "ID": "Cosgrave2007"}, {"year": "2011", "volume": "20", "title": "{Asymmetric boundary shifts of tropical montane Lidoptera over four decades of climate warming}", "pages": "34--45", "journal": "Global Ecology and Biogeography", "author": "Chen, I C and Hill, J K and Shiu, H J and Holloway, J D and Buedick, S and Chey, V K and Barlow, H S and Thomas, C D", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Chen2011"}, {"year": "2007", "title": "{Industry, settlement and society}", "publisher": "Cambridge University Press", "pages": "357--390", "editor": "Parry, M L and {Canziani Palutikof,J.P.}, O F and {Van der Linden}, P and Hanson, C E", "booktitle": "Climate Change 2007: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability.

About 60{\\%} of the world's known ecosystems are currently used unsustainably. In Europe, the richness and abundance of biodiversity is undergoing significant decline, partly due to climate change. This article outlines the impacts of climate change on biodiversity by showing both observed and projected changes in the distribution and phenology of plants and animals (phenology refers to changes in the timing of seasonal events). The four major findings are the following. (1) Concerning the distribution of plant species, climate change is responsible for the observed northward and uphill distribution shifts of many European plant species. By the late 21st century, distributions of European plant species are projected to have shifted several hundred kilometres to the north, forests are likely to have contracted in the south and expanded in the north, and 60{\\%} of mountain plant species may face extinction. The rate of change will exceed the ability of many species to adapt. (2) Concerning plant phenology, the timing of seasonal events in plants is changing across Europe due to changes in climate conditions. For instance, 78{\\%} of leaf unfolding and flowering records show advancing trends. Between 1971 and 2000, the average advance of spring and summer was 2.5 days per decade. The pollen season starts on average 10 days earlier and is longer than 50 years ago. Trends in seasonal events will continue to advance as climate warming increases in the years and decades to come. (3) Concerning the distribution of animal species, Europe's birds, insects, and mammals are moving northwards and uphill in response to observed climate change. Rate of climate change, habitat fragmentation and other obstacles will impede the movement of many animal species. Distribution changes are projected to continue. Suitable climatic conditions for Europe's breeding birds are projected to shift nearly 550 km northeast by the end of the century. Projections for 120 native European mammals suggest that up to 9{\\%} face extinction during the 21st century. (4) Concerning animal phenology, climatic warming has caused advancement in the life cycles of many animal groups, including frogs spawning, birds nesting and the arrival of migrant birds and butterflies. Seasonal advancement is particularly strong and rapid in the Arctic. Breeding seasons are lengthening, allowing extra generations of temperature-sensitive insects such as butterflies, dragonflies and pest species to be produced during the year. These trends are projected to continue as climate warming increases in the decades to come. Populations may explode if the young are not exposed to normal predation pressures. Conversely, populations may crash if the emergence of vulnerable young is not in synchrony with their main food source or if shorter hibernation times lead to declines in body condition.", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Feehan2009"}, {"year": "2008", "volume": "322", "title": "{Physiology and climate change}", "pages": "690--692", "number": "5902", "keywords": "Adaptation, Physiological,Climate,Ecosystem,Fishes -- Physiology,Plankton -- Physiology", "journal": "Science", "issn": "{\\textless}b{\\textgreater}E-ISSN:{\\textless}/b{\\textgreater} 1095-9203 ; {\\textless}b{\\textgreater}ISSN:{\\textless}/b{\\textgreater} 0036-8075 ; {\\textless}b{\\textgreater}PMID:{\\textless}/b{\\textgreater} 18974339", "author": "P{\\\"{o}}rtner, H O and Farrell, A P", "annote": "ID: TN{\\_}medline18974339; NO: Science (New York, N.Y.), 2008, Vol.322(5902), pp.690-2", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Portner2008a"}, {"year": "2006", "volume": "80", "title": "{The impact of major heat waves on all-cause and cause-specific mortality in France from 1971 to 2003}", "pages": "615--626", "journal": "International Archives of Occupational and Environmental Health", "author": "Rey, G and Jougla, E and Fouillet, A and Pavillon, G and Bessemoulin, P and Frayssinet, P and Clavel, J and H{\\'{e}}mon, D", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Rey2006"}, {"year": "2010", "title": "{National responsibilities for adaptation strategies: Lessons from four modelling frameworks}", "author": "Aaheim, A and Dokken, T and Hochrainer, S and Hof, A and Jochem, E and Mechler, R and {Van Vuuren}, D P", "abstract": "Most of the literature about adaptation and vulnerability deals with decision making on a local level. This chapter examines the possible relevance of developing national or global adaptation strategies, and shorts out possible challenges. Firstly, the challenge in balancing mitigation and adaptation is discussed. Adaptation is very efficient, but substantial damages will remain even after optimal adaptation. Large regional differences in adaptation costs indicate the importance of establishing an international adaptation regime. Secondly, a closer examination of the energy system identifies innovations required to utilise the full potential for adaptation, and emphasises that successful R{\\&}D strategies may turn challenges into a competitive advantage. Thirdly, the possible market barriers to adaptation are identified. It is shown that climate change is likely to increase migration of labour and capital to urban areas. This adaptation is, however, hampered because capital, labour and natural resources are immobile to a certain extent. Finally, depending on the economic and financial vulnerability of an economy and its key actors, and the extent and frequency of disasters, countries may exhibit differential economic follow-on effects after a disaster. It shown that increased frequencies and intensities of disasters, such as floods, may have substantial fiscal and macroeconomic consequences. An identification of governments' roles in adaptation strategies is important, but is far from comprehensive when it comes to potential issues. Public goods are used as a common denominator for the identification of subjects to which governments should pay attention. A lot of research remains before an extensive overview of adaptation options, which can be characterised as public goods on a national scale, can be provided.", "ENTRYTYPE": "incollection", "ID": "Aaheim2010"}, {"year": "2012", "title": "{Australia and New Zealand Perspectives on Climate Change and Agriculture}", "publisher": "American Society of Agronomy and Imperial College Press", "pages": "107--142", "editor": "Rosenzweig, C and Hillel, D", "booktitle": "Handbook of Climate Change and Agroecosystems: Global and Regional Aspects and Implications", "author": "Thorburn, P J and Robertson, M J and Clothier, B E and Snow, V O and Charmley, E and Sanderman, J and Teixeira, E and Dynes, Robyn A and Hall, Alistair and Brown, Hamish and Howden, S Mark and Battaglia, Michael", "address": "New York", "ENTRYTYPE": "incollection", "ID": "Thorburn2012"}, {"year": "2013", "title": "{Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations Database on Agriculture}", "publisher": "http://faostat.fao.org", "author": "FAOSTAT", "annote": "Accessed 17 September 2013", "address": "Rome, Italy", "ENTRYTYPE": "techreport", "ID": "FAOSTAT2013"}, {"year": "1997", "title": "{Megadiversity.

China is now facing the worst air pollution problem in the world, and is also the largest emitter of carbon dioxide. A number of epidemiological studies on air pollution and population health have been conducted in China, using time-series, case-crossover, cross-sectional, cohort, panel or intervention designs. The increased health risks observed among Chinese population are somewhat lower in magnitude, per amount of pollution, than the risks found in developed countries. However, the importance of these increased health risks is greater than that in North America or Europe, because the levels of air pollution in China are very high in general and Chinese population accounts for more than one fourth of the world's totals. Meanwhile, evidence is mounting that climate change has already affected human health directly and indirectly in China, including mortality from extreme weather events; changes in air and water quality; and changes in the ecology of infectious diseases. If China acts to reduce the combustion of fossil fuels and the resultant air pollution, it will reap not only the health benefits associated with improvement of air quality but also the reduced GHG emissions. Consideration of the health impact of air pollution and climate change can help the Chinese government move forward towards sustainable development with appropriate urgency.", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Kan2011"}, {"year": "2007", "title": "{Cross-chapter case study}", "publisher": "Cambridge University Press", "pages": "864--868", "booktitle": "Climate Change 2007: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability.

Some regions are becoming overly dependent on it, consuming groundwater faster than it is naturally replenished and causing water tables to decline unremittingly1. Indirect evidence suggests that this is the case in northwest India2, but there has been no regional assessment of the rate of groundwater depletion. Here we use terrestrial water storage-change observations from the NASA Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellites3 and simulated soil-water variations from a data-integrating hydrological modelling system4 to show that groundwater is being depleted at a mean rate of 4.0 1.0 cm yr-1 equivalent height of water (17.7 4.5 km3 yr-1) over the Indian states of Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana (including Delhi). During our study period of August 2002 to October 2008, groundwater depletion was equivalent to a net loss of 109 km3 of water, which is double the capacity of India's largest surface-water reservoir. Annual rainfall was close to normal throughout the period and we demonstrate that the other terrestrial water storage components (soil moisture, surface waters, snow, glaciers and biomass) did not contribute significantly to the observed decline in total water levels. Although our observational record is brief, the available evidence suggests that unsustainable consumption of groundwater for irrigation and other anthropogenic uses is likely to be the cause. If measures are not taken soon to ensure sustainable groundwater usage, the consequences for the 114,000,000 residents of the region may include a reduction of agricultural output and shortages of potable water, leading to extensive socioeconomic stresses.", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Rodell2009"}, {"year": "2010", "volume": "26", "title": "{Expansion dynamics of monospecific, temperate mangroves and sedimentation in two embayments of a barrier-enclosed lagoon, Tauranga Harbour, New Zealand}", "publisher": "Coastal Education and Research Foundation", "pages": "113--122", "number": "1", "journal": "Journal of Coastal Research", "author": "Stokes, Debra J and Healy, Terry R and Cooke, Penelope J", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Stokes2010"}, {"year": "2012", "title": "{Thailand's 2011 flooding: its impact on direct exports and global supply chains.

The extremely heavy rain in early January 2011 fell on the catchments of heavily saturated Brisbane and Stanley Rivers systems resulting in significant runoff which rapidly produced a widespread and devastating flood event. The area of inundation was equivalent to the total land area of France and Germany combined. Over 200,000 people were affected leaving 35 people dead and 9 missing. The damage bill was estimated at over {\\$}1B and cost to the economy at over {\\$}10B with over 30,000 homes and 6,000 business flooded and 86 towns and regional centres affected. The need to disburse disaster funding in a prompt manner to the affected population was paramount to facilitate individuals getting their lives back to some normality. However, the payout of insurance claims has proved to be a major area of community anger. The ongoing impasse in payment of insurance compensation is attributed to the nature and number of claims, confusing definition of flooding and the lack or accuracy of information needed to determine individually the properties affected and legitimacy of claims. Information was not readily available at the micro-level including, extent and type of inundation, flood heights at property level and cause of damage. Events during the aftermath highlighted widespread community misconceptions concerning the technical factors associated with the flood event and the impact of such on access to legitimate compensation and assistance. Individual and community wide concerns and frustration, anger and depression, have arisen resulting from delays in the timely settlement of insurance claims. Lessons learnt during the aftermath are presented in the context of their importance as a basis for inculcating communities impacted by the flood event with resilience for the future.", "ENTRYTYPE": "inproceedings", "ID": "Hayes2012"}, {"year": "2006", "volume": "305", "title": "{Trends in river floods: why is there no clear signal in observations?}", "pages": "1--18", "journal": "IAHS/UNESCO Kovacs Colloquium Frontiers in Flood Research.", "author": "Svensson, C and Hannaford, J and Kundzewicz, Z W and Marsh, T J", "annote": "ID: 83", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Svensson2006"}, {"year": "2011", "volume": "1", "url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nclimate1106", "title": "{Tried and tested}", "pages": "71", "number": "2", "journal": "Nature Climate Change", "issn": "1758-678X", "author": "Stocker, T F and Qin, Dahe and Plattner, G K and Midgley, P and Tignor, M", "annote": "id: 1; issn: print 1758-678X; issn: electronic 1758-6798; publication{\\_}type: full{\\_}text ", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Stocker2011"}, {"year": "2010", "volume": "277", "title": "{Direct and indirect climate forcing in a multi-species marine system}", "pages": "3411--3420", "number": "1699", "keywords": "Climate Change,Ecosystem,Fishes -- Physiology,Zooplankton -- Physiology", "journal": "Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences", "issn": "{\\textless}b{\\textgreater}E-ISSN:{\\textless}/b{\\textgreater} 1471-2954 ; {\\textless}b{\\textgreater}ISSN:{\\textless}/b{\\textgreater} 0962-8452 ; {\\textless}b{\\textgreater}PMID:{\\textless}/b{\\textgreater} 20538646", "author": "Stige, L C and Ottersen, G and Dalpadado, P and Chan, K S and Hjermann, D and Lajus, D L and Yaragina, N A and Stenseth, N C", "annote": "NO: Proceedings.

Here we identify direct and indirect climate effects by analysing unique Russian time-series data from the Norwegian Sea-Barents Sea ecosystem on the first life stages of cod, capelin, herring and haddock, their predators, competitors and zooplanktonic prey. By analysing growth and survival from one life stage to the next (eggs-larvae-juveniles-recruits), we find evidence for both bottom-up, direct and top-down effects of climate. Ambient zooplankton biomass predicts survival of all species, whereas ambient temperature mainly affects survival through effects on growth. In warm years, all species experienced improved growth and feeding conditions. Cohorts born following a warm year will, however, experience increased predation and competition because of increased densities of subadult cod and herring, leading to delayed climate effects. While climate thus affects early growth and survival through several mechanisms, only some of the identified mechanisms were found to be significant predictors of population growth. In particular, our findings exemplify that climate impacts are barely propagated to later life stages when density dependence is strong.", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Stige2010"}, {"year": "2009", "title": "{5th Urban Research Symposium \"Cities and Climate Change: Responding to the Urgent Agenda\".

In this study, a crop simulation model (DSSAT) was used to assess the impact of different climate change scenarios on rainfed wheat and barley in the Yarmouk basin in Jordan. Analysis of observed crop data showed differences between cultivated and harvested areas for both crops in the study area with variations among years. Results from DSSAT model for years showed that it was able to capture the trend of yield over the years realistically well. The model predicted an average yield of wheat of 1176 kg ha \u22121, which was close to the average (1173 kg ha \u22121) obtained from the data of department of statistics (DOS), and an average predicted yield of barley was 927 kg ha \u22121 while the DOS average was 922 kg ha \u22121, with higher RMSE for barley (476 kg ha \u22121) than for wheat (319 kg ha \u22121). Results for predicting future yield of both crops showed that the responses of wheat and barley were different under different climate change scenarios. The reduction of rainfall by 10\u201320{\\%} reduced the expected yield by 4\u20138{\\%} for barley and 10\u201320{\\%} for wheat, respectively.

Collaboration between climate and LMR scientists and shared understanding of critical challenges for such applications are essential for developing robust projections of climate impacts on LMRs. This paper assesses present approaches for generating projections of climate impacts on LMRs using IPCC-class climate models, recommends practices that should be followed for these applications, and identifies priority developments that could improve current projections. Understanding of the climate system and its representation within climate models has progressed to a point where many climate model outputs can now be used effectively to make LMR projections. However, uncertainty in climate model projections (particularly biases and inter-model spread at regional to local scales), coarse climate model resolution, and the uncertainty and potential complexity of the mechanisms underlying the response of LMRs to climate limit the robustness and precision of LMR projections. A variety of techniques including the analysis of multi-model ensembles, bias corrections, and statistical and dynamical downscaling can ameliorate some limitations, though the assumptions underlying these approaches and the sensitivity of results to their application must be assessed for each application. Developments in LMR science that could improve current projections of climate impacts on LMRs include improved understanding of the multi-scale mechanisms that link climate and LMRs and better representations of these mechanisms within more holistic LMR models. These developments require a strong baseline of field and laboratory observations including long time series and measurements over the broad range of spatial and temporal scales over which LMRs and climate interact. Priority developments for IPCC-class climate models include improved model accuracy (particularly at regional and local scales), inter-annual to decadal-scale predictions, and the continued development of earth system models capable of simulating the evolution of both the physical climate system and biosphere. Efforts to address these issues should occur in parallel and be informed by the continued application of existing climate and LMR models.", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Stock2010"}, {"year": "2011", "volume": "3", "title": "{Field note from Pakistan floods: Preventing future flood disasters}", "pages": "453--463", "number": "2", "journal": "J{\\`{a}}mb{\\'{a}}: Journal of Disaster Risk Studies", "author": "Oxley, M", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Oxley2011"}, {"year": "2011", "volume": "1", "url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nclimate1092", "title": "{The value of attribution.}", "pages": "70--71", "number": "2", "journal": "Nature Climate Change", "issn": "1758-678X", "author": "Brander, Keith and Bruno, John and Hobday, Alistair and Schoeman, David", "annote": "id: 1; issn: print 1758-678X; issn: electronic 1758-6798; publication{\\_}type: full{\\_}text ", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Brander2011"}, {"year": "2011", "title": "{Revolt on the Nile.

Demand is identified using current-period shocks that give rise to exogenous shifts in supply. Supply is identified using past shocks, which affect expected future prices through inventory accretion or depletion. We use our estimated elasticities to evaluate the impact of ethanol subsidies and mandates on world food commodity prices, quantities, and food consumers' surplus. The current US ethanol mandate requires that about 5 percent of world caloric production from corn, wheat, rice, and soybeans be used for ethanol generation. As a result, world food prices are predicted to increase by about 30 percent and global consumer surplus from food consumption is predicted to decrease by 155 billion dollars annually. If a third of the biofuel calories are recycled as feed stock for livestock, the predicted price increase scales back to 20 percent.

Morley, Alison Massey, Helen Rossetti Keywords: acclimation; adaptation; climate change; macrophysiology; species range; model; resistance Abstract: Summary Climate change is affecting species distributions and will increasingly do so. However, current understanding of which individuals and species are most likely to survive and why is poor. Knowledge of assemblage or community level effects is limited and the balance of mechanisms that are important over different time-scales is poorly described. Laboratory experiments on marine animals predominantly employ rates of change 10-100 000 times faster than climate induced oceanic warming. To address this failure we investigated differences in individual and species abilities to tolerate warming, and also how rate of warming affected survival. This study identifies community level effects of thermal biology by applying a multi-species, multi-trophic level approach to the analysis of temperature limits. Within species analyses of 14 species from 6 phyla showed smaller individuals survived to higher temperatures than large animals when temperatures were raised acutely. If this trend continues at slower warming rates, the early loss of larger individuals has marked consequences at the population level as larger individuals form the major reproductive component. Between species comparisons showed active species survived to higher temperatures than sessile or low activity groups. Thus active groups (e.g. predators) and juvenile or immature individuals should fare better in rapid warming scenarios. This would be expected to produce short-term ecological imbalances in warming events. The rate of warming markedly affected temperature limits in a wide range of Antarctic marine species. Different species survived to temperatures of 8*3-17*6 degrees]C when temperatures were raised by around 1 degrees]C day.sup.-1. However they only survived to temperatures between 4*0 degrees]C and 12*3 degrees]C when temperatures were raised by around 1-2 degrees]C week.sup.-1, and temperatures of only 1*0-6*0 degrees]C were tolerated for acclimations over periods of months. Current models predicting range changes of species in response to climate change are either correlative or mechanistic. Mechanistic models offer the potential to incorporate the ecophysiological adaptation and evolutionary processes which determine future responses and go beyond simple correlative approaches. These models depend on the incorporation of data on species capacities to resist and adapt to change. This study is an important step in the provision of such data from experimental manipulations.

Operators increasingly take tourists to destinations threatened by climate change, with Antarctica and other polar regions as favourites and cruise ship and aircraft as main transport modes. The selling point is to see a destination before it disappears, a form of last chance tourism. This has been claimed to increase the environmental awareness of tourists and make them \u201cambassadors\u201d for conservation and the visited destination. Antarctic cruise ship passengers tripled from 2000 to 2007. The paper finds that high levels of greenhouse gas emissions are created by cruise ship tourists in general, and especially high levels for those visiting the Antarctic, up to approximately eight times higher per capita and per day than average international tourism trips. A survey found no evidence for the hypothesis that the trips develop greater environmental awareness, change attitudes or encourage more sustainable future travel choices. Of the Antarctic cruise passengers surveyed, 59{\\%} felt that their travel did not impact on climate change; fewer than 7{\\%} had or might offset their emissions. Alternative opportunities for visitation to glacial/polar destinations that comply with the desire to reduce future emissions are discussed.", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Eijgelaar2010"}, {"year": "2010", "volume": "Firenze, I", "title": "{Emerging risks related to new lakes in deglaciating areas of the Alps}", "pages": "453--458", "booktitle": "Mountain Risks: Bringing Science to Society.

While there is general agreement that a regime shift consists of a restructuring of a marine ecosystem, the form of restructuring that constitutes a regime shift remains under debate. At present, we identify regime shifts through exploratory data analysis but what types of data are appropriate and how should the data be treated. There are many different possible variables to consider in describing a marine ecosystem. There are even many different categories of variables: physical, biogeochemical, habitat, and organismal (from bacteria and plankton through zooplankton to fish). It is possible to consider hundreds or indeed thousands of variables for a given marine ecosystem. Given the complexity of regime shifts, and the potential for misidentification, the selection of the data, and the approach taken to the analysis are important. The results of the analysis of very complex data sets can be quite sensitive to the approach taken to the analysis. The first step in the analysis is a consideration of what we are looking for. In analyzing data for patterns, we need to know the characteristics of the pattern for which we are searching. With a template in hand, we can then consider the different approaches available for pattern extraction from the data. Since a regime shift is rarely identified through a single variable or time series, a common strategy is to bring together many different time series including both physical and biological data. The typical first step in the analysis is normalization of the data followed by some form of data summation or integration to reduce noise in order that the desired signal is more apparent. Most of the techniques are numerically quite straightforward, although some can be computationally demanding. While there is no unambiguous technique at present, the application of available techniques has been useful in improving our understanding of ocean regime states and shifts. No pure statistical analysis can replace our understanding of the underlying dynamical relations of the various variables, which can be enhanced by explicit dynamic modeling.", "ENTRYTYPE": "incollection", "ID": "DeYoung2009"}, {"year": "2004", "volume": "33", "url": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15387075", "title": "{Global change and the boreal forest: thresholds, shifting states or gradual change?}", "publisher": "BioOne", "pmid": "15387075", "pages": "361--365", "number": "6", "month": "aug", "keywords": "Arctic Regions,Conservation of Natural Resources,Environment,Greenhouse Effect,Policy Making,Population Dynamics,Social Conditions,Trees,Trees: growth {\\&} development", "journal": "AMBIO: A Journal of the Human Environment", "issn": "0044-7447", "file": "::", "author": "Chapin, F Stuart and Callaghan, Terry V and Bergeron, Yves and Fukuda, M and Johnstone, J F and Juday, G and Zimov, S a and {Chapin III}, F Stuart", "abstract": "Changes in boreal climate of the magnitude projected for the 21st century have always caused vegetation changes large enough to be societally important. However, the rates and patterns of vegetation change are difficult to predict. We review evidence suggesting that these vegetation changes may be gradual at the northern forest limit or where seed dispersal limits species distribution. However, forest composition may be quite resilient to climate change in the central portions of a species range until some threshold is surpassed. At this point, changes can be rapid and unexpected, often causing a switch to very different ecosystem types. Many of these triggers for change are amenable to management, suggesting that our choice of policies in the coming decades will substantially influence the ecological and societal consequences of current climatic change.", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "ChapinIII2004"}, {"volume": "57", "title": "{Distinguishing the effects of climate on discharge in a tropical river highly impacted by large dams}", "journal": "Hydrological Sciences Journal-Journal Des Sciences Hydrologiques", "issn": "0262-6667", "file": "::", "author": "Genz, F and Luz, L D", "annote": "{\\textless}m:note{\\textgreater}        {\\textless}m:bold{\\textgreater}From Duplicate 2 ( {\\textless}/m:bold{\\textgreater}        {\\textless}m:bold{\\textgreater}          {\\textless}/m:bold{\\textgreater}{\\textless}m:bold{\\textgreater}{\\textless}m:italic{\\textgreater}Distinguishing the effects of climate on discharge in a tropical river highly impacted by large dams{\\textless}/m:italic{\\textgreater}{\\textless}/m:bold{\\textgreater}{\\textless}m:bold{\\textgreater}        {\\textless}/m:bold{\\textgreater}        {\\textless}m:bold{\\textgreater} - Genz, F; Luz, L D ){\\textless}m:linebreak/{\\textgreater}        {\\textless}/m:bold{\\textgreater}        {\\textless}m:linebreak/{\\textgreater}PT: J; TC: 0; UT: WOS:000306111300013{\\textless}m:linebreak/{\\textgreater}        {\\textless}m:linebreak/{\\textgreater}      {\\textless}/m:note{\\textgreater}", "abstract": "The hydrological regime of a river is defined by variables or representative curves that in turn have characteristics related to fluctuations in flow rates resulting from climate variability. Distinguishing between the causes of streamflow variations, i.e. those resulting from human intervention in the watershed and those due to climate variability, is not trivial. To discriminate the alterations resulting from climate variation from those due to regulation by dams, a reference hydrological regime was established using the classification of events based on mean annual streamflow anomalies and inferred climatic conditions. The applicability of this approach was demonstrated by analysis of the streamflow duration curves. An assessment of the hydrological regime in the lower reaches of the Sao Francisco River, Brazil, after the implementation of hydropower plants showed that the operation of the dams has been responsible for 59{\\%} of the hydrological changes, while the climate (in driest conditions) has contributed to 41{\\%} of the total changes.", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Genz2012"}, {"year": "2008", "url": "http://www.grid.unep.ch/glaciers/", "title": "{Global Glacier Changes : facts and figures}", "publisher": "UNEP, World Glacier Monitoring Service", "pages": "88", "isbn": "9789280728989", "institution": "UNEP World Glacier Monitoring Service", "file": ":C$\\backslash$:/Users/hans{\\_}gi/AppData/Local/Mendeley Ltd./Mendeley Desktop/Downloaded/Zemp - 2008 - Global Glacier Changes facts and figures Contents.pdf:pdf;:C$\\backslash$:/Users/hans{\\_}gi/AppData/Local/Mendeley Ltd./Mendeley Desktop/Downloaded/WGMS - 2008 - Global Glacier Changes facts and figures.pdf:pdf", "editor": "Zemp, Michael and Roer, I and K{\\\"{a}}{\\\"{a}}b, A and Hoelzle, M and Paul, F and Haeberli, W", "author": "WGMS", "annote": "From Duplicate 1 ( Global Glacier Changes : facts and figures Contents - Zemp, Michael )\n\n\n\nFrom Duplicate 2 ( Global Glacier Changes : facts and figures - WGMS )\n\nFrom Duplicate 1 ( Global Glacier Changes : facts and figures - WGMS )\nAnd Duplicate 3 ( Global glacier changes.
