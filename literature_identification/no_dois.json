If, as anticipated, they dry this century, they might accelerate climate change through carbon losses and changed surface energy balances. We used records from multiple long-term monitoring plots across Amazonia to assess forest responses to the intense 2005 drought, a possible analog of future events. Affected forest lost biomass, reversing a large long-term carbon sink, with the greatest impacts observed where the dry season was unusually intense. Relative to pre-2005 conditions, forest subjected to a 100-millimeter increase in water deficit lost 5.3 megagrams of aboveground biomass of carbon per hectare. The drought had a total biomass carbon impact of 1.2 to 1.6 petagrams (1.2 \u00d7 1015 to 1.6 \u00d7 1015 grams). Amazon forests therefore appear vulnerable to increasing moisture stress, with the potential for large carbon losses to exert feedback on climate change.", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Phillips2009"}, {"year": "2010", "url": "http://193.194.138.236/pdf/supporting-material/uncertainty-guidance-note.pdf", "title": "{Guidance notes for lead authors of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report on consistent treatment of uncertainties}", "publisher": "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Geneva, Switzerland", "pages": "5", "keywords": "adaptation,climate change science,mitigation", "file": "::", "author": "Mastrandrea, M D and Field, C B and Stocker, T F and Edenhofer, O and Ebi, K L and Frame, D J and Held, H and Kriegler, E and Mach, K J and Matschoss, P R and Plattner, G K and Yohe, G W and Zwiers, F W", "ENTRYTYPE": "techreport", "ID": "Mastrandrea2010"}, {"year": "2008", "volume": "35", "title": "{Climate warming and related changes in Mediterranean marine biota}", "pages": "5--21", "journal": "CIESM Workshop Monographs", "author": "Boero, F and F{\\'{e}}ral, J P and Azzurro, E and Cardin, V and Riedel, B and Despalatovi{\\'{c}}, Marija and Munda, I and Moschella, P and Zaouali, J and {Fonda Umani}, S", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Boero2008"}, {"year": "2010", "volume": "14", "title": "{Streamflow trends in Europe: evidence from a dataset of near-natural catchments.}", "pages": "2367--2382", "journal": "Hydrology and Earth System Sciences Discussions", "author": "Stahl, K and Hisdal, H and Hannaford, J and Tallaksen, L and {Van Lanen}, H and Sauquet, E and Demuth, S and Fendekova, M and Jordar, J", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Stahl2010"}, {"year": "2008", "url": "http://site.ebrary.com/lib/stanford/Doc?id=10199687", "title": "{Climate variability and the global harvest: impacts of El Ni{\\textcopyright}{\\l}o and other oscillations on agroecosystems}", "publisher": "Oxford University Press", "pages": "259", "keywords": "Climate and civilization,Climatic changes,Crops and climate,El Ni{\\textcopyright}{\\l}o Current,Forecasting", "isbn": "0195137639;

Recent in situ observations have suggested that larch-dominated taiga and permafrost behave as a coupled eco-climate system across a broad boreal zone of Siberia. However, neither field-based observations nor modeling experiments have clarified the synthesized dynamics of this system. Here, using a new dynamic vegetation model coupled with a permafrost model, we reveal the processes of interaction between the taiga and permafrost. The model demonstrates that under the present climate conditions in eastern Siberia, larch trees maintain permafrost by controlling the seasonal thawing of permafrost, which in turn maintains the taiga by providing sufficient water to the larch trees. The experiment without permafrost processes showed that larch would decrease in biomass and be replaced by a dominance of pine and other species that suffer drier hydroclimatic conditions. In the coupled system, fire not only plays a destructive role in the forest, but also, in some cases, preserves larch domination in forests. Climate warming sensitivity experiments show that this coupled system cannot be maintained under warming of about 2 degrees C or more. Under such conditions, a forest with typical boreal tree species (dark conifer and deciduous species) would become dominant, decoupled from the permafrost processes. This study thus suggests that future global warming could drastically alter the larch-dominated taiga-permafrost coupled system in Siberia, with associated changes of WEC processes and feedback to climate.", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Zhang"}, {"year": "2012", "title": "{Destruction, Disinvestment, and Death: Economic and Human Losses Following Environmental Disaster}", "journal": "NBER Working paper series", "author": "Anttila-Hughes, Jesse K and Hsiang, Solomon M", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Anttila-Hughes2012"}, {"year": "2010", "volume": "21", "url": "http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-78650432650{\\&}partnerID=40{\\&}md5=c4d5b294424634b7abe5eaf6be0adc89", "title": "{A lump of coal, a bunch of grapes}", "pages": "107--111", "number": "2", "journal": "Journal of Wine Research", "author": "Smart, R E", "address": "Honorary Research Associate, School of Agricultural Science, University of Tasmania, Launceston, Australia", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Smart2010"}, {"year": "2013", "title": "{Coastal Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerabilities: A Technical Input to the 2013 National Climate Assessment}", "publisher": "Island Press", "pages": "216", "author": "Burkett, Virginia and Davidson, M A", "address": "Washington DC, USA", "ENTRYTYPE": "book", "ID": "Burkett2013"}, {"year": "2013", "title": "{Resilience of international policies to changing social-ecological systems: Arctic shipping in the Bering Strait}", "publisher": "Arctic Council, Stockholm Environment Institute and Stockholm Resilience Centre", "pages": "99--104", "booktitle": "Arctic Resilience Interim Report", "author": "Robards, M", "address": "Stockholm, Sweden", "ENTRYTYPE": "incollection", "ID": "Robards2013"}, {"year": "2006", "volume": "35", "title": "{Forest carbon management in the United States}", "publisher": "American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, Soil Science Society", "pages": "1461--1469", "number": "4", "journal": "Journal of Environmental Quality", "author": "Birdsey, Richard and Pregitzer, Kurt and Lucier, Alan", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Birdsey2006"}, {"year": "2007", "url": "http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic470466.files/Commodity Price Shocks and Civil Conflict {\\_} Evidence from Colombia{\\_}Oeindrila Dube{\\_}October 08.pdf", "title": "{Commodity price shocks and civil conflict: Evidence from Colombia}", "month": "jan", "booktitle": "Working Paper", "author": "Dube, O and Vargas, J", "abstract": "Measures of other municipal characteristics, including population, rainfall and temperature are obtained from the player in the world coffee mar{\\{}$\\backslash${\\&}{\\}} ket, and its coffee may have Urdinola (2006) independently developed a similar measure of coffee price in Colombia.", "ENTRYTYPE": "techreport", "ID": "Dube2007"}, {"year": "2012", "volume": "18", "title": "{Virtual Special Issue on food security \u2013 greater than anticipated impacts of near-term global atmospheric change on rice and wheat.}", "pages": "1489--1490", "journal": "Global Change Biology", "author": "Long, S P", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Long2012"}, {"year": "2009", "url": "www.bom.gov.au/climate/current/statements/scs17d.pdf", "title": "{The exceptional January-February 2009 Heatwave in South-Eastern Australia}", "publisher": "National Climate Centre, Bureau of Meteorology", "author": "BOM", "address": "Canberra", "ENTRYTYPE": "misc", "ID": "BOM2009"}, {"year": "2011", "volume": "24", "title": "{The role of human activity in the recent warming of extremely warm daytime temperatures}", "pages": "1922--1930", "number": "7", "journal": "Journal of Climate", "author": "Christidis, Nikolaos and Stott, Peter A and Brown, Simon J", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Christidis2011"}, {"year": "2012", "volume": "49", "title": "{Climate clashes?

This Article will look at the implications of Resolution 7/23 for global climate change responses. It will argue that the application of human rights principles and norms can bring a range of benefits to international and national efforts to respond to global warming, and that the obstacles to doing so are mainly practical difficulties, related in particular to the entrenched \"path dependence\" of the two policy areas. This Article will also turn this premise around to suggest ways in which the issue of climate change could or should affect international human rights policy. In particular, it will argue that the issue of climate change points to the need for a reconceptualization of human rights, and suggests the need for a reconsideration of the utility of environmental rights. The Article mainly reflects the views of a political rather than a legal practitioner, although these views are necessarily embedded in law. This Article is divided into four sections.

The change in the cooling water temperature can be experienced due to the seasonal changes in climatic conditions at plant site. It can also come into the question of design processes for the plant site selection. In the analysis, it is considered that the condenser vacuum varies with the temperature of cooling water extracted from environment into the condenser. The main findings of the paper is that the impact of 1\u00b0C increase in temperature of the coolant extracted from environment is predicted to yield a decrease of \u223c0.45 and \u223c0.12{\\%} in the power output and the thermal efficiency of the pressurized-water reactor nuclear-power plant considered, respectively.

South\u2010eastern Pacific coast, between 18\u00b020\u2032\u2003S and 42\u00b035\u2032\u2003S. Past southern endpoints of distribution were obtained for 10 intertidal species from museum collections and literature reviews. Current endpoints are based on field sampling conducted between 1998 and 2000. Changes in the position of southern endpoints were analysed individually for each species, as well as for the entire assemblage of species included in the analysis. SST records encompassing 51\u201357\u2003years were obtained from five coastal stations located between 18\u00b0 and 36\u00b0\u2003S. Most species (eight of 10) did not show expansion of their southern endpoint. The proportion of species expanding, contracting or maintaining their southern limit did not differ from chance expectation. On average, species showed small (1\u00b0 latitude), non\u2010significant contractions, with low rates of decadal change (0.18\u00b0 latitude per 10\u2003years). This pattern can be explained by changes in SST, which showed a weak warming trend (and at some sites even cooling) along the Chilean coast during the last 57\u2003years. Our results show that different regional warming trends occur, and suggest that generalizations about poleward shifts in species ranges cannot be made.

When CO 2 levels reached \u223c340 ppm, sporadic but highly destructive mass bleaching occurred in most reefs world-wide, often associated with El Ni{\\~{n}}o events. Recovery was dependent on the vulnerability of individual reef areas and on the reef's previous history and resilience. At today's level of \u223c387 ppm, allowing a lag-time of 10 years for sea temperatures to respond, most reefs world-wide are committed to an irreversible decline. Mass bleaching will in future become annual, departing from the 4 to 7 years return-time of El Ni{\\~{n}}o events. Bleaching will be exacerbated by the effects of degraded water-quality and increased severe weather events. In addition, the progressive onset of ocean acidification will cause reduction of coral growth and retardation of the growth of high magnesium calcite-secreting coralline algae. If CO 2 levels are allowed to reach 450 ppm (due to occur by 2030\u20132040 at the current rates), reefs will be in rapid and terminal decline world-wide from multiple synergies arising from mass bleaching, ocean acidification, and other environmental impacts. Damage to shallow reef communities will become extensive with consequent reduction of biodiversity followed by extinctions. Reefs will cease to be large-scale nursery grounds for fish and will cease to have most of their current value to humanity. There will be knock-on effects to ecosystems associated with reefs, and to other pelagic and benthic ecosystems. Should CO 2 levels reach 600 ppm reefs will be eroding geological structures with populations of surviving biota restricted to refuges. Domino effects will follow, affecting many other marine ecosystems. This is likely to have been the path of great mass extinctions of the past, adding to the case that anthropogenic CO 2 emissions could trigger the Earth's sixth mass extinction.", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Veron2009"}, {"year": "2007", "title": "{Inter-agency real-time evaluation of the response to the February 2007 floods and cyclone in Mozambique}", "publisher": "Inter-Agency Humanitarian Standing Committee", "pages": "91", "author": "Cosgrave, J and Goncalves, C and Martyris, D and Polastro, R and Sikumba-Dils, M", "annote": "http://www.unicef.org/evaldatabase/files/MOZ$\\backslash${\\_}RTE$\\backslash${\\_}2007$\\backslash${\\_}Floodsandcyclone.pdf", "address": "http://www.unicef.org/evaldatabase/files/MOZ{\\_}RTE{\\_}2007{\\_}Floodsandcyclone.pdf", "ENTRYTYPE": "techreport", "ID": "Cosgrave2007"}, {"year": "2011", "volume": "20", "title": "{Asymmetric boundary shifts of tropical montane Lidoptera over four decades of climate warming}", "pages": "34--45", "journal": "Global Ecology and Biogeography", "author": "Chen, I C and Hill, J K and Shiu, H J and Holloway, J D and Buedick, S and Chey, V K and Barlow, H S and Thomas, C D", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Chen2011"}, {"year": "2007", "title": "{Industry, settlement and society}", "publisher": "Cambridge University Press", "pages": "357--390", "editor": "Parry, M L and {Canziani Palutikof,J.P.}, O F and {Van der Linden}, P and Hanson, C E", "booktitle": "Climate Change 2007: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability.

About 60{\\%} of the world's known ecosystems are currently used unsustainably. In Europe, the richness and abundance of biodiversity is undergoing significant decline, partly due to climate change. This article outlines the impacts of climate change on biodiversity by showing both observed and projected changes in the distribution and phenology of plants and animals (phenology refers to changes in the timing of seasonal events). The four major findings are the following. (1) Concerning the distribution of plant species, climate change is responsible for the observed northward and uphill distribution shifts of many European plant species. By the late 21st century, distributions of European plant species are projected to have shifted several hundred kilometres to the north, forests are likely to have contracted in the south and expanded in the north, and 60{\\%} of mountain plant species may face extinction. The rate of change will exceed the ability of many species to adapt. (2) Concerning plant phenology, the timing of seasonal events in plants is changing across Europe due to changes in climate conditions. For instance, 78{\\%} of leaf unfolding and flowering records show advancing trends. Between 1971 and 2000, the average advance of spring and summer was 2.5 days per decade. The pollen season starts on average 10 days earlier and is longer than 50 years ago. Trends in seasonal events will continue to advance as climate warming increases in the years and decades to come. (3) Concerning the distribution of animal species, Europe's birds, insects, and mammals are moving northwards and uphill in response to observed climate change. Rate of climate change, habitat fragmentation and other obstacles will impede the movement of many animal species. Distribution changes are projected to continue. Suitable climatic conditions for Europe's breeding birds are projected to shift nearly 550 km northeast by the end of the century. Projections for 120 native European mammals suggest that up to 9{\\%} face extinction during the 21st century. (4) Concerning animal phenology, climatic warming has caused advancement in the life cycles of many animal groups, including frogs spawning, birds nesting and the arrival of migrant birds and butterflies. Seasonal advancement is particularly strong and rapid in the Arctic. Breeding seasons are lengthening, allowing extra generations of temperature-sensitive insects such as butterflies, dragonflies and pest species to be produced during the year. These trends are projected to continue as climate warming increases in the decades to come. Populations may explode if the young are not exposed to normal predation pressures. Conversely, populations may crash if the emergence of vulnerable young is not in synchrony with their main food source or if shorter hibernation times lead to declines in body condition.", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Feehan2009"}, {"year": "2006", "volume": "77", "title": "{Unplanned land clearing of Colombian rainforests: Spreading like disease?}", "pages": "240--254", "number": "3", "journal": "Landscape and Urban Planning", "issn": "0169-2046", "author": "Etter, Andres and McAlpine, Clive and Phinn, Stuart and Pullar, David and Possingham, Hugh", "annote": "PT: J; TC: 13; UT: WOS:000240085800003", "abstract": "Deforestation often occurs as temporal waves and in localized fronts termed 'deforestation hotspots' driven by economic pulses and population pressure. Of particular concern for conservation planning are 'biodiversity hotspots' where high concentrations of endemic species undergo rapid loss and fragmentation of habitat. We investigate the deforestation process in Caqueta, a biodiversity hotspot and major colonization front of the Colombian Amazon using multi-temporal satellite imagery of the periods 1989-1996-1999-2002. The probabilities of deforestation and regeneration were modeled against soil fertility, accessibility and neighborhood terms, using logistic regression analysis. Deforestation and regeneration patterns and rates were highly variable across the colonization front. The regional average annual deforestation rate was 2.6{\\%}, but varied locally between -1.8{\\%} (regeneration) and 5.3{\\%}, with maximum rates in landscapes with 40-60{\\%} forest cover and highest edge densities, showing an analogous pattern to the spread of disease. Soil fertility and forest and secondary vegetation neighbors showed positive and significant relationships with the probability of deforestation. For forest regeneration, soil fertility had a significant negative effect while the other parameters were marginally significant. The logistic regression models across all periods showed a high level of discrimination power for both deforestation and forest regeneration, with ROC values {\\textgreater} 0.80. We document the effect of policies and institutional changes on the land clearing process, such as the failed peace process between government and guerillas in 1999-2002, which redirected the spread of deforestation and increased forest regeneration. The implications for conservation in biologically rich areas, such as Caqueta are discussed.

This chapter examines the possible relevance of developing national or global adaptation strategies, and shorts out possible challenges. Firstly, the challenge in balancing mitigation and adaptation is discussed. Adaptation is very efficient, but substantial damages will remain even after optimal adaptation. Large regional differences in adaptation costs indicate the importance of establishing an international adaptation regime. Secondly, a closer examination of the energy system identifies innovations required to utilise the full potential for adaptation, and emphasises that successful R{\\&}D strategies may turn challenges into a competitive advantage. Thirdly, the possible market barriers to adaptation are identified. It is shown that climate change is likely to increase migration of labour and capital to urban areas. This adaptation is, however, hampered because capital, labour and natural resources are immobile to a certain extent. Finally, depending on the economic and financial vulnerability of an economy and its key actors, and the extent and frequency of disasters, countries may exhibit differential economic follow-on effects after a disaster. It shown that increased frequencies and intensities of disasters, such as floods, may have substantial fiscal and macroeconomic consequences. An identification of governments' roles in adaptation strategies is important, but is far from comprehensive when it comes to potential issues. Public goods are used as a common denominator for the identification of subjects to which governments should pay attention. A lot of research remains before an extensive overview of adaptation options, which can be characterised as public goods on a national scale, can be provided.", "ENTRYTYPE": "incollection", "ID": "Aaheim2010"}, {"year": "2010", "volume": "37", "title": "{Historical trends in Southern Ocean storminess.

Identifying susceptible populations is of particular importance given anticipated rising temperatures from climatic change. We investigated heat-related mortality for three Latin American cities (Mexico City, Mexico; S{\\~{a}}o Paulo, Brazil; Santiago, Chile) using a case-crossover approach for 754 291 deaths from 1998 to 2002. We considered lagged exposures, confounding by air pollution, cause of death and susceptibilities by educational attainment, age and sex. Same and previous day apparent temperature were most strongly associated with mortality risk. Effect estimates remained positive though lowered after adjustment for ozone or PM. Susceptibility increased with age in all cities. The increase in mortality risk for those \u226565 comparing the 95th and 75th percentiles of same-day apparent temperature was 2.69{\\%} (95{\\%} CI: \u22122.06 to 7.88{\\%}) for Santiago, 6.51{\\%} (95{\\%} CI: 3.57\u20139.52{\\%}) for S{\\~{a}}o Paulo and 3.22{\\%} (95{\\%} CI: 0.93\u20135.57{\\%}) for Mexico City. Patterns of vulnerability by education and sex differed across communities. Effect estimates were higher for women than men in Mexico City, and higher for men elsewhere, although results by sex were not appreciably different for any city. In S{\\~{a}}o Paulo, those with less education were more susceptible, whereas no distinct patterns by education were observed in the other cities. Elevated temperatures are associated with mortality risk in these Latin American cities, with the strongest associations in S{\\~{a}}o Paulo, the hottest city.

Growing at elevations {\\textless}1.4 m in the Florida Keys, USA, the endangered Key tree cactus (Pilosocereus robinii) experienced 84 percent loss of total stems from 1994 to 2007. The most severe losses of 99 and 88 percent stems occurred in the largest populations in the Lower Keys, where nine storms with high wind velocities and storm surges, occurred during this period. In contrast, three populations had substantial stem proliferation. To evaluate possible mortality factors related to changes in climate or forest structure, we examined habitat variables: soil salinity, elevation, canopy cover, and habitat structure near 16 dying or dead and 18 living plants growing in the Lower Keys. Soil salinity and elevation were the preliminary factors that discriminated live and dead plants. Soil salinity was 1.5 times greater, but elevation was 12 cm higher near dead plants than near live plants. However, distribution-wide stem loss was not significantly related to salinity or elevation. Controlled salinity trials indicated that salt tolerance to levels above 40 mM NaCl was related to maternal origin. Salt sensitive plants from the Lower Keys had less stem growth, lower root:shoot ratios, lower potassium: sodium ratios and lower recovery rate, but higher $\\delta$ (13)C than a salt tolerant lineage of unknown origin. Unraveling the genetic structure of salt tolerant and salt sensitive lineages in the Florida Keys will require further genetic tests. Worldwide rare species restricted to fragmented, low-elevation island habitats, with little or no connection to higher ground will face challenges from climate change-related factors.

The authors' insights are used to inform a more general set of reflections on the nature of urban and environmental change, and the linkages between the two. Three over-arching themes are identified: the centrality of vulnerability and resilience as concepts shaping urban responses to climate change; the growing recognition of the role of specific governance mechanisms and systems at different scales in shaping the design and implementation of responses; and the particularities, cross-cutting issues and connections between cities from different regions (e.g., Europe, East Africa) in addressing this challenge. Notwithstanding the rapidly growing volume of information on this area of research, the challenge will be to develop frameworks to understand and effectively respond to the complex interactions between urban development, the carbon cycle and the climate system, and to turn the hazards resulting from human pressures on the environment into sources of opportunities and innovations aimed at building more resilient and sustainable cities.", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Romero-Lankao2011"}, {"year": "2012", "title": "{Plant Species Composition and Diversity in Cliff and Mountain Ecosystems}", "publisher": "University of Gothenburg", "author": "Antonsson, H", "ENTRYTYPE": "phdthesis", "ID": "Antonsson2012"}, {"year": "2008", "volume": "9", "title": "{Normalised hurricane damage in the United States: 1900-2005}", "pages": "29--42", "journal": "Natural Hazards Review", "author": "{Pielke Jr}, R A and Gratz, J and Landsea, C W and Collins, D and Saunders, M A and Musulin, R", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "PielkeJr2008"}, {"year": "2007", "title": "{Ecosystems, their properties, goods, and services.

How populations and communities cope with such climatic extremes is a question central to contemporary ecology and biodiversity conservation. Previous work has shown that species diversity can affect ecosystem functioning and resilience. Here, we show that genotypic diversity can replace the role of species diversity in a species-poor coastal ecosystem, and it may buffer against extreme climatic events. In a manipulative field experiment, increasing the genotypic diversity of the cosmopolitan seagrass Zostera marina enhanced biomass production, plant density, and faunal abundance, despite near-lethal water temperatures due to extreme warming across Europe. Net biodiversity effects were explained by genotypic complementarity rather than by selection of particularly robust genotypes. Positive effects on invertebrate fauna suggest that genetic diversity has second-order effects reaching higher trophic levels. Our results highlight the importance of maintaining genetic as well as species diversity to enhance ecosystem resilience in a world of increasing uncertainty.

We included all land-cover types located below the natural montane tree line (similar to 3000 m), including forest, savanna, scrubland, seasonal wetland, second-growth forest, pasture, and cropland.

Land-use change was quantified for 10 groups within which cultural traditions and production systems are shared, including three nonmechanized indigenous groups, four mechanized farming groups, two cattle ranching groups, and the forest products sector. Mechanized Cruceno farmers and Andean indigenous colonists were responsible for most land-use change in the 1960s and 1970s; deforestation by the latter group increased to twice that by all other groups during 1986-1991, declined in the 1990s, and then increased again in the most recent period. In the last 15 years, land-use change by agro-industrialists specializing in soybean has become important, and cattle ranching based on cultivated pastures has surpassed land use by all other groups.

China is now facing the worst air pollution problem in the world, and is also the largest emitter of carbon dioxide. A number of epidemiological studies on air pollution and population health have been conducted in China, using time-series, case-crossover, cross-sectional, cohort, panel or intervention designs. The increased health risks observed among Chinese population are somewhat lower in magnitude, per amount of pollution, than the risks found in developed countries. However, the importance of these increased health risks is greater than that in North America or Europe, because the levels of air pollution in China are very high in general and Chinese population accounts for more than one fourth of the world's totals. Meanwhile, evidence is mounting that climate change has already affected human health directly and indirectly in China, including mortality from extreme weather events; changes in air and water quality; and changes in the ecology of infectious diseases. If China acts to reduce the combustion of fossil fuels and the resultant air pollution, it will reap not only the health benefits associated with improvement of air quality but also the reduced GHG emissions. Consideration of the health impact of air pollution and climate change can help the Chinese government move forward towards sustainable development with appropriate urgency.", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Kan2011"}, {"year": "2007", "title": "{Cross-chapter case study}", "publisher": "Cambridge University Press", "pages": "864--868", "booktitle": "Climate Change 2007: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability.

Little is known about the effects of mangrove area loss on individual mangrove species and local or regional populations. To address this gap, species-specific information on global distribution, population status, life history traits, and major threats were compiled for each of the 70 known species of mangroves. Each species' probability of extinction was assessed under the Categories and Criteria of the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Eleven of the 70 mangrove species (16{\\%}) are at elevated threat of extinction. Particular areas of geographical concern include the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of Central America, where as many as 40{\\%} of mangroves species present are threatened with extinction. Across the globe, mangrove species found primarily in the high intertidal and upstream estuarine zones, which often have specific freshwater requirements and patchy distributions, are the most threatened because they are often the first cleared for development of aquaculture and agriculture. The loss of mangrove species will have devastating economic and environmental consequences for coastal communities, especially in those areas with low mangrove diversity and high mangrove area or species loss.

Such anomalies reached their peak in a striking visual phenomenon: the first appearance in the area of bright waters caused by massive blooms of the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi ( E. huxleyi). This study is intended to provide an insight into the mechanisms of phytoplankton succession in the south-eastern part of the shelf during such years and addresses the causes of E. huxleyi success by means of a 2-layer ecosystem model, field data and satellite-derived information. A number of potential hypotheses are delineated based on observations conducted in the area and on previous knowledge of E. huxleyi general ecology. Some of these hypotheses are then considered as causative factors and explored with the model. The unusual climatic conditions of 1997 resulted most notably in a particularly shallow mixed layer depth and high sea surface temperature (about 4 \u00b0C above climatological mean). Despite the fact that the model could not reproduce for E. huxleyi a clear non-bloom to bloom transition (pre- vs. post-1997), several tests suggest that this species was favoured by the shallow mixed layer depth in conjunction with a lack of photoinhibition. A top-down control by microzooplankton selectively grazing phytoplankton other than E. huxleyi appears to be responsible for the long persistence of the blooms. Interestingly, observations reveal that the high N:P ratio hypothesis, regarded as crucial in the formation of blooms of this species in previous studies, does not hold on the Bering Sea shelf.", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Merico2004"}, {"year": "2007", "title": "{Assessing key vulnerabilities and the risk from climate change}", "publisher": "Cambridge University Press", "pages": "779--810", "editor": "Parry, M L and Canziani, O F and Palutikof, J P and {Van der Linden}, P and Hanson, C E", "booktitle": "Climate Change 2007: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability.

Some regions are becoming overly dependent on it, consuming groundwater faster than it is naturally replenished and causing water tables to decline unremittingly1. Indirect evidence suggests that this is the case in northwest India2, but there has been no regional assessment of the rate of groundwater depletion. Here we use terrestrial water storage-change observations from the NASA Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellites3 and simulated soil-water variations from a data-integrating hydrological modelling system4 to show that groundwater is being depleted at a mean rate of 4.0 1.0 cm yr-1 equivalent height of water (17.7 4.5 km3 yr-1) over the Indian states of Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana (including Delhi). During our study period of August 2002 to October 2008, groundwater depletion was equivalent to a net loss of 109 km3 of water, which is double the capacity of India's largest surface-water reservoir. Annual rainfall was close to normal throughout the period and we demonstrate that the other terrestrial water storage components (soil moisture, surface waters, snow, glaciers and biomass) did not contribute significantly to the observed decline in total water levels. Although our observational record is brief, the available evidence suggests that unsustainable consumption of groundwater for irrigation and other anthropogenic uses is likely to be the cause. If measures are not taken soon to ensure sustainable groundwater usage, the consequences for the 114,000,000 residents of the region may include a reduction of agricultural output and shortages of potable water, leading to extensive socioeconomic stresses.", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Rodell2009"}, {"year": "2011", "volume": "1", "url": "http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v1/n9/abs/nclimate1293.html{\\#}supplementary-information", "title": "{A drought-induced pervasive increase in tree mortality across Canada's boreal forests}", "publisher": "Nature Publishing Group", "pages": "467--471", "number": "9", "journal": "Nature Climate Change", "issn": "1758-678X", "file": "::", "author": "Peng, Changhui and Ma, Zhihai and Lei, Xiangdong and Zhu, Qiuan and Chen, Huai and Wang, Weifeng and Liu, Shirong and Li, Weizhong and Fang, Xiuqin and Zhou, Xiaolu", "annote": "J2: Nature Clim.

The extremely heavy rain in early January 2011 fell on the catchments of heavily saturated Brisbane and Stanley Rivers systems resulting in significant runoff which rapidly produced a widespread and devastating flood event. The area of inundation was equivalent to the total land area of France and Germany combined. Over 200,000 people were affected leaving 35 people dead and 9 missing. The damage bill was estimated at over {\\$}1B and cost to the economy at over {\\$}10B with over 30,000 homes and 6,000 business flooded and 86 towns and regional centres affected. The need to disburse disaster funding in a prompt manner to the affected population was paramount to facilitate individuals getting their lives back to some normality. However, the payout of insurance claims has proved to be a major area of community anger. The ongoing impasse in payment of insurance compensation is attributed to the nature and number of claims, confusing definition of flooding and the lack or accuracy of information needed to determine individually the properties affected and legitimacy of claims. Information was not readily available at the micro-level including, extent and type of inundation, flood heights at property level and cause of damage. Events during the aftermath highlighted widespread community misconceptions concerning the technical factors associated with the flood event and the impact of such on access to legitimate compensation and assistance. Individual and community wide concerns and frustration, anger and depression, have arisen resulting from delays in the timely settlement of insurance claims.

Here we identify direct and indirect climate effects by analysing unique Russian time-series data from the Norwegian Sea-Barents Sea ecosystem on the first life stages of cod, capelin, herring and haddock, their predators, competitors and zooplanktonic prey. By analysing growth and survival from one life stage to the next (eggs-larvae-juveniles-recruits), we find evidence for both bottom-up, direct and top-down effects of climate. Ambient zooplankton biomass predicts survival of all species, whereas ambient temperature mainly affects survival through effects on growth. In warm years, all species experienced improved growth and feeding conditions. Cohorts born following a warm year will, however, experience increased predation and competition because of increased densities of subadult cod and herring, leading to delayed climate effects. While climate thus affects early growth and survival through several mechanisms, only some of the identified mechanisms were found to be significant predictors of population growth. In particular, our findings exemplify that climate impacts are barely propagated to later life stages when density dependence is strong.", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Stige2010"}, {"year": "2009", "title": "{5th Urban Research Symposium \"Cities and Climate Change: Responding to the Urgent Agenda\".

Over the 1968\u20131990 (year of planting) study period, the linear increase in yield (\u00b1 standard error) was 57.2 (\u00b1 12.8) kg ha \u22121 y \u22121 ( r 2 = 0.49) or 1.27 (\u00b1 0.26) {\\%} y \u22121 ( r 2 = 0.51).

In an attempt to allow for yearly weather variation, two yield models (one simulation-based and one regression-based) assuming no change in cultivar or management were used to predict the weather-based potential yield of each year. These predicted yields showed a significant linear decline over the study period apparently due to a small increase in temperature. When average Valley yields were adjusted against simulated yields to take into account the variation in weather, the overall linear rate of yield gain increased to 103 (\u00b1 14.8) kg ha \u22121 y \u22121 ( r 2 = 0.69) or 1.91 (\u00b1 0.22) {\\%} y \u22121 ( r 2 = 0.78).

Changnon (1) Abstract: Winter storms are a major weather problem in the USA and their losses have been rapidly increasing. A total of 202 catastrophic winter storms, each causing more than {\\$}1 million in damages, occurred during 1949--2003, and their losses totaled {\\$}35.2 billion (2003 dollars). Catastrophic winter storms occurred in most parts of the contiguous USA, but were concentrated in the eastern half of the nation where 88{\\%} of all storm losses occurred. They were most frequent in the Northeast climate district (95 storms), and were least frequent in the West district (14 catastrophic storms). The annual average number of storms is 3.7 with a 1-year high of 9 storms, and 1 year had no storms. Temporal distributions of storms and their losses exhibited considerable spatial variability across the nation. For example, when storms were very frequent in the Northeast, they were infrequent elsewhere, a result of spatial differences in storm-producing synoptic weather conditions over time. The time distribution of the nation's 202 storms during 1949--2003 had a sizable downward trend, whereas the nation's storm losses had a major upward trend for the 55-year period. This increase over time in losses, given the decrease in storm incidences, was a result of significant temporal increases in storm sizes and storm intensities. Increases in storm intensities were small in the northern sections of the nation, but doubled across the southern two-thirds of the nation, reflecting a climatic shift in conditions producing intense winter storms.

Bank voles are the rodent reservoir of the responsible hantavirus and are known to display cyclic population peaks. We tried to relate these peaks to the cyclic NE outbreaks observed since 1993. Our hypothesis was that the ecological causal connection was the staple food source for voles, being seeds of deciduous broad-leaf trees, commonly called \"mast\". We also examined whether past temperature and precipitation preceding \"mast years\" were statistically linked to these NE outbreaks. Results Since 1993, each NE peak is immediately preceded by a mast year, resulting in significantly higher NE case numbers during these peaks (Spearman R = -0.82; P = 0.034). NE peaks are significantly related to warmer autumns the year before (R = 0.51; P {\\textless} 0.001), hotter summers two years before (R = 0.32; P {\\textless} 0.001), but also to colder (R = -0.25; P {\\textless} 0.01) and more moist summers (R = 0.39; P {\\textless} 0.001) three years before. Summer correlations were even more pronounced, when only July was singled out as the most representative summer month. Conclusion NE peaks in year 0 are induced by abundant mast formation in year-1, facilitating bank vole survival during winter, thus putting the local human population at risk from the spring onwards of year 0. This bank vole survival is further promoted by higher autumn temperatures in year-1, whereas mast formation itself is primed by higher summer temperatures in year-2. Both summer and autumn temperatures have been rising to significantly higher levels during recent years, explaining the virtually continuous epidemic state since 2005 of a zoonosis, considered rare until recently. Moreover, in 2007 a NE peak and an abundant mast formation occurred for the first time within the same year, thus forecasting yet another record NE incidence for 2008. We therefore predict that with the anticipated climate changes due to global warming, NE might become a highly endemic disease in Belgium and surrounding countries.", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Clement2009"}, {"year": "2011", "volume": "1", "url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nclimate1143", "title": "{Early warning of climate tipping points.}", "pages": "201--209", "number": "4", "journal": "Nature Climate Change", "issn": "1758-678X", "author": "Lenton, T M", "annote": "id: 1; issn: print 1758-678X; issn: electronic 1758-6798; publication{\\_}type: full{\\_}text ", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Lenton2011"}, {"year": "2013", "volume": "online", "title": "{Two contrasting seasonal extremes in tropical South America in 2012: Flood in Amazonia and drought in Northeast Brazil}", "journal": "Journal of Climate", "author": "Marengo, J A and Alves, L M and Soares, W R and Rodriguez, D A and Camargo, H and {Paredes Riveros}, M and {Diaz Pablo}, A", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Marengo2013"}, {"year": "2010", "title": "{In the shadow of melting glaciers.

In this study, a crop simulation model (DSSAT) was used to assess the impact of different climate change scenarios on rainfed wheat and barley in the Yarmouk basin in Jordan. Analysis of observed crop data showed differences between cultivated and harvested areas for both crops in the study area with variations among years. Results from DSSAT model for years showed that it was able to capture the trend of yield over the years realistically well. The model predicted an average yield of wheat of 1176 kg ha \u22121, which was close to the average (1173 kg ha \u22121) obtained from the data of department of statistics (DOS), and an average predicted yield of barley was 927 kg ha \u22121 while the DOS average was 922 kg ha \u22121, with higher RMSE for barley (476 kg ha \u22121) than for wheat (319 kg ha \u22121). Results for predicting future yield of both crops showed that the responses of wheat and barley were different under different climate change scenarios. The reduction of rainfall by 10\u201320{\\%} reduced the expected yield by 4\u20138{\\%} for barley and 10\u201320{\\%} for wheat, respectively. The increase in rainfall by 10\u201320{\\%} increased the expected yield by 3\u20135{\\%} for barley and 9\u201318{\\%} for wheat, respectively.

Data on the vector tick Ixodes ricinus suggest that an extension of its northern and altitude range has been accompanied by an increased prevalence of tick-borne encephalitis. Climate change may also be partly responsible for the change in distribution of Dermacentor reticulatus . Increased winter activity of I. ricinus is probably due to warmer winters and a retrospective study suggests that hotter summers will change the dynamics and pattern of seasonal activity, resulting in the bulk of the tick population becoming active in the latter part of the year. Climate suitability models predict that eight important tick species are likely to establish more northern permanent populations in a climate-warming scenario. However, the complex ecology and epidemiology of such tick-borne diseases as Lyme borreliosis and tick-borne encephalitis make it difficult to implicate climate change as the main cause of their increasing prevalence. Climate change models are required that take account of the dynamic biological processes involved in vector abundance and pathogen transmission in order to predict future tick-borne disease scenarios.", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Gray2009"}, {"year": "2007", "volume": "44", "title": "{Quantifying the impact of longline fisheries on adult survival in the black\u2010footed albatross}", "publisher": "Wiley Online Library", "pages": "942--952", "number": "5", "journal": "Journal of Applied Ecology", "author": "V{\\'{e}}ran, S and Gimenez, O and Flint, E and Kendall, W L and Doherty, P F Jr and Lebreton, J D", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Veran2007"}, {"year": "2011", "volume": "38", "title": "{A century of tree line changes in sub\u2010Arctic Sweden shows local and regional variability and only a minor influence of 20th century climate warming}", "publisher": "Wiley Online Library", "pages": "907--921", "number": "5", "journal": "Journal of Biogeography", "author": "{Van Bogaert}, R and Haneca, K and Hoogesteger, J and Jonasson, C and {De Dapper}, M and Callaghan, T V", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "VanBogaert2011"}, {"year": "2011", "volume": "28", "title": "{Climate change, rainfall, society and disasters in Latin America.

Consequently, the tourist phenomenon in general is heavily controlled by meteorological conditions\u2014in short, by the climate. In this article, the author proposes a set of weather types with which to establish the climate aptitude for sun and beach tourism. To determine these types, the density of use of one of the beaches with the lowest seasonality in continental Europe, the Levante Beach in Benidorm (Alicante, Spain), was analysed. Beach attendance was monitored using a webcam installed by the \u201cAgencia Valenciana de Turismo\u201d. The relationship between the density of use of the lower and upper beach areas on the one hand, and meteorological variables on the other, allowed comfort (physiological equivalent temperature) and enjoyment (fractions of solar radiation) thresholds to be established. The appropriate hydric comfort values were obtained by comparing the ranges proposed by Besancenot in 1989 [Besancenot (1989) Clima et turismes. Massom, Par{\\'{i}}s] with numbers of visitors to the beach. The wind velocity and precipitation thresholds were selected following consultation with the literature and considering the climatic characteristics of the environment under analysis. Based on a combination of these thresholds, weather types suitable for this specific tourist activity are defined. Thus, this article presents a method for assessing the extent to which a day on the beach can be enjoyed. This has a number of applications, for planners, the tourism business and consumers alike. The use of this (filter) method in climate databases and meteorological forecasts could help determine the tourist season, the suitability of setting up a business associated with sun and beach tourism, as well as help plan holidays and program a day's leisure activities. Thus, the article seeks to improve our understanding of the climate preferences of that tourist activity par excellence: sun and beach tourism.", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Ibarra2011"}, {"year": "2011", "title": "{Economic growth and political survival}", "number": "2011/06", "journal": "ANU Working Paper", "author": "Burke, P J", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Burke2011"}, {"year": "2012", "title": "{Australian floods and their impact on insurance}", "publisher": "The Geneva Association", "pages": "81--91", "editor": "Courbage, C and Stahel, W R", "booktitle": "Extreme events and insurance: 2011 annus horribilis", "author": "Ma, E Q and Guinery, M J and McCarthy, P and Shaw, R", "address": "Geneva, Switzerland", "ENTRYTYPE": "incollection", "ID": "Ma2012a"}, {"year": "1994", "volume": "26", "title": "{Plastic particles found in the gizzard of a starved Black-footed Albatross (Diomedea nigripes)}", "pages": "77--80", "journal": "Journal of the Yamashina Institute for Orinithology", "author": "Ogi, H and Momose, K and Sato, F and Baba, N", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Ogi1994"}, {"year": "2006", "volume": "325", "url": "http://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v325/p227-241/", "title": "{Cod and climate.

Only studies controlling CO 2 ] during all (or most) of the wheat life cycle were considered. Studies were divided into five categories based on the method of controlling CO 2 ]: laboratory-chamber, glasshouse (greenhouse), closed-top field chamber, open-top field chamber (OTC), and a free-air (chamberless) field CO 2 enrichment (FACE) system. Only three studies, all conducted in glasshouses, included subambient-CO 2 ] treatments ( CO 2 ]{\\textless}330 ppm ) , with yield positively related to CO 2 ] in all three. In superambient-CO 2 ] experiments with ample water and nutrients and with favorable temperature, CO 2 ] up to about 2000 ppm increased yield, with a maximum effect (+37{\\%}) at about 890 ppm CO 2 (according to curve fitting with data from all methods pooled). On average, doubling CO 2 ] from 350 to 700 ppm increased yield about 31{\\%}. Differences in effects of CO 2 ] on yield between methods of controlling CO 2 ] could not be judged (or did not exist) because of large variation in yield across chamber (including glasshouse) experiments and too few FACE experiments. Side-by-side comparisons of different methods of controlling CO 2 ] in which yield was measured were notably lacking. The large variation in effect of CO 2 ] on yield, even with ample water and nutrients, probably reflected interactions between CO 2 ] and other factors. With mineral nutrient limitations, effects of CO 2 ] on yield were small, and with severe nutrient limitations increased CO 2 ] sometimes reduced yield. With ample nutrients and CO 2 ] greater than 2000 ppm, yield was also reduced, but this may be of limited significance to field crops for at least the next 100 years. Elevated CO 2 ] stimulated yield of water-stressed wheat, but usually did not fully compensate for water shortage, though few data were available. Elevated O 3 ] sometimes reduced positive effects of elevated CO 2 ] on yield, though again, few data were available. Usually, modest warming (1\u20134\u00b0C) counteracted positive effects of doubled CO 2 ] on yield.

Collaboration between climate and LMR scientists and shared understanding of critical challenges for such applications are essential for developing robust projections of climate impacts on LMRs. This paper assesses present approaches for generating projections of climate impacts on LMRs using IPCC-class climate models, recommends practices that should be followed for these applications, and identifies priority developments that could improve current projections. Understanding of the climate system and its representation within climate models has progressed to a point where many climate model outputs can now be used effectively to make LMR projections. However, uncertainty in climate model projections (particularly biases and inter-model spread at regional to local scales), coarse climate model resolution, and the uncertainty and potential complexity of the mechanisms underlying the response of LMRs to climate limit the robustness and precision of LMR projections. A variety of techniques including the analysis of multi-model ensembles, bias corrections, and statistical and dynamical downscaling can ameliorate some limitations, though the assumptions underlying these approaches and the sensitivity of results to their application must be assessed for each application. Developments in LMR science that could improve current projections of climate impacts on LMRs include improved understanding of the multi-scale mechanisms that link climate and LMRs and better representations of these mechanisms within more holistic LMR models. These developments require a strong baseline of field and laboratory observations including long time series and measurements over the broad range of spatial and temporal scales over which LMRs and climate interact. Priority developments for IPCC-class climate models include improved model accuracy (particularly at regional and local scales), inter-annual to decadal-scale predictions, and the continued development of earth system models capable of simulating the evolution of both the physical climate system and biosphere. Efforts to address these issues should occur in parallel and be informed by the continued application of existing climate and LMR models.", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Stock2010"}, {"year": "2012", "volume": "9", "title": "{What drives \ufb02ood trends along the Rhine River: climate or river training?}", "pages": "13537--13567", "journal": "Hydrology and Earth System Sciences Discussions", "author": "Vorogushyn, S and Merz, B", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Vorogushyn2012"}, {"year": "2011", "volume": "3", "title": "{Field note from Pakistan floods: Preventing future flood disasters}", "pages": "453--463", "number": "2", "journal": "J{\\`{a}}mb{\\'{a}}: Journal of Disaster Risk Studies", "author": "Oxley, M", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Oxley2011"}, {"year": "2011", "volume": "1", "url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nclimate1092", "title": "{The value of attribution.}", "pages": "70--71", "number": "2", "journal": "Nature Climate Change", "issn": "1758-678X", "author": "Brander, Keith and Bruno, John and Hobday, Alistair and Schoeman, David", "annote": "id: 1; issn: print 1758-678X; issn: electronic 1758-6798; publication{\\_}type: full{\\_}text ", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Brander2011"}, {"year": "2011", "title": "{Revolt on the Nile.

This paper is concerned with the disappearing island as a space in which new intersections between environmentalism and tourism can be explored. It analyzes specifically western representational practices associated with climate change imperatives on Tuvalu, an atoll state in the central Pacific. New phenomena are emerging there such as climate change tourism and the transformation of the islands into showcases of renewable energy. These phenomena are analyzed in order to understand how climate change meanings are being shaped by various participants in the debate. I argue that Pacific islanders are heroized as climate change saviours when environmentalists attempt to locate ethnocentric notions of environmentally harmonious, \u2018traditional' culture on disappearing islands. Further, islanders are objectified in the rhetoric of climate change tourism. Imagined destinies for atoll dwellers as climate saviours are sited uncomfortably alongside voyeuristic gazes turned towards inundated islands. Competing forces of compassion and voyeurism produced in the name of the Tuvaluan indigene are entrenching an iconic role for the Tuvaluan atoll dweller as climate change hero/victim.", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Farbotko2010"}, {"year": "2010", "title": "{Arctic biodiversity trends 2010 \u2013 Selected indicators of change}", "publisher": "Arctic Council, Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna Working Group, International Secretariat", "pages": "124", "isbn": "978-9979-9778-3-4", "booktitle": "2010", "author": "CAFF", "address": "Akureyri, Iceland", "ENTRYTYPE": "book", "ID": "CAFF2010"}, {"year": "2010", "volume": "93", "title": "{Climate shocks and sino-nomadic conflict}", "pages": "970--998", "number": "3", "journal": "The review of economics and statistics", "author": "Bai, Y and Kung, J K", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Bai2010"}, {"year": "2006", "volume": "114", "title": "{Climate variability and change and their potential health effects in small Island states.

We examined effects of fishing, climate, adult habitat, and age-at-maturation on long-term variation of fish populations. We tested the hypothesis that populations of unexploited taxa track climatic trends more closely than those of exploited taxa insofar as climatic signals may be confounded by fishing effects. Most oceanic taxa (23/34) showed a significant relationship with environmental variables and followed the trend of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Very few coastal (3/10) and coastal-oceanic (3/23) taxa exhibited a significant relationship with environmental signals; however, several fluctuated coherently, and age-at-maturation is an important factor. The lack of close correlation between fish populations and environmental signals in the coastal and coastal-oceanic assemblages indicates that these species might show nonlinear biological responses to external forcing rather than a simple linear tracking of environmental variables. We did not find a systematic pattern indicating that fishing influenced population fluctuation of exploited species. Constrained comparisons of exploited to unexploited species living in the same habitat and reaching maturity at the same age revealed evidence of overexploitation for some species but not for all. Our results suggest that considering life history and ecological characteristics of fish species and applying a community approach are important in understanding fishing effects on fish populations in the context of a changing environment.", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Hsieh2005"}, {"year": "2009", "volume": "101", "title": "{Climate change affecting rice production.

Specifically, it asks how this strategy, which is an adaptation to a relatively recent convergence of economic and environmental uncertainty in this context, is accepted and reproduced by society at large, even as this adaptation results in unevenly distributed benefits and costs. An examination of the case in question suggests that the persistence of this adaptation has little to do with its material outcomes. This adaptation persists because, despite its unequal and less-than-optimal material outcomes, it is rooted in the ability of men to link this adaptation to existing gender roles, thereby legitimizing the adaptation and the gendered roles it relies upon. This finding calls into question the very idea of a successful adaptation, and suggests that much more attention must be paid to the persistence of particular adaptations if we are to understand existing adaptations and build upon them to enhance local capacities for managing economic and environmental change.", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Carr2008"}, {"year": "2010", "volume": "15921", "title": "{Identifying supply and demand elasticities of agricultural commodities: Implications for the US ethanol mandate}", "journal": "National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series", "author": "Roberts, Michael J and Schlenker, Wolfram", "annote": "Author contact info: Michael J.

Demand is identified using current-period shocks that give rise to exogenous shifts in supply. Supply is identified using past shocks, which affect expected future prices through inventory accretion or depletion. We use our estimated elasticities to evaluate the impact of ethanol subsidies and mandates on world food commodity prices, quantities, and food consumers' surplus. The current US ethanol mandate requires that about 5 percent of world caloric production from corn, wheat, rice, and soybeans be used for ethanol generation. As a result, world food prices are predicted to increase by about 30 percent and global consumer surplus from food consumption is predicted to decrease by 155 billion dollars annually. If a third of the biofuel calories are recycled as feed stock for livestock, the predicted price increase scales back to 20 percent. While commodity demand is extremely inelastic, price response is muted by a significant supply response that is obscured if futures prices are not instrumented. The resulting expansion of agricultural growing area potentially offsets the CO2 emission benefits from biofuels.", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Roberts2010"}, {"year": "2008", "title": "{Climate change and tourism: Responding to global challenges}", "publisher": "World Tourism Organization; United Nations Environment Programme", "pages": "269", "author": "Scott, D and Amelung, B and Becken, S and Ceron, J P and Dubois, G and G{\\\"{o}}ssling, S and Peeters, P and Simpson, M C", "address": "Madrid; Paris", "ENTRYTYPE": "techreport", "ID": "Scott2008"}, {"year": "2008", "volume": "60", "title": "{Recent changes of water discharge and sediment load in the Zhujiang (Pearl River) Basin, China}", "pages": "365--380", "number": "3", "keywords": "abrupt change,gradual trend,sediment load,the Zhujiang (Pearl River),time series analysis,water discharge", "journal": "Global and Planetary Change", "issn": "0921-8181", "author": "Zhang, S and Lu, X X and Higgitt, D L and Chen, C T A and Han, J and Sun, H", "annote": "ID: 3600; M3: 10.1016/j.gloplacha.2007.04.003", "abstract": "The paper is concerned with identifying changes in the time series of water and sediment discharge of the Zhujiang (Pearl River), China.

Both the Mann{\\~{A}}\u00a2{\\^{a}}\u201a\u00ac{\\^{a}}\u20ac{\\oe}Kendall and Pettitt tests indicate that water discharge at all stations in the Zhujiang Basin showed no significant trend or abrupt shift. Annual water discharges are mainly influenced by precipitation variability, while the construction of reservoirs/dams in the Zhujiang Basin had little influence on water discharge. Sediment load, however, showed significant decreasing trends at some stations in the main channel of the Xijiang and Dongjiang. More stations have seen significantly decreasing trends since the 1990s. The decreasing sediment load in the Zhujiang reflects the impacts of reservoir construction in the basin. In contrast, the Liujiang, the second largest tributary of the Xijiang, has experienced a significant upward shift of sediment load around 1991 likely caused by exacerbated rock desertification in the karst regions.

Morley, Alison Massey, Helen Rossetti Keywords: acclimation; adaptation; climate change; macrophysiology; species range; model; resistance Abstract: Summary Climate change is affecting species distributions and will increasingly do so. However, current understanding of which individuals and species are most likely to survive and why is poor. Knowledge of assemblage or community level effects is limited and the balance of mechanisms that are important over different time-scales is poorly described. Laboratory experiments on marine animals predominantly employ rates of change 10-100 000 times faster than climate induced oceanic warming. To address this failure we investigated differences in individual and species abilities to tolerate warming, and also how rate of warming affected survival. This study identifies community level effects of thermal biology by applying a multi-species, multi-trophic level approach to the analysis of temperature limits. Within species analyses of 14 species from 6 phyla showed smaller individuals survived to higher temperatures than large animals when temperatures were raised acutely. If this trend continues at slower warming rates, the early loss of larger individuals has marked consequences at the population level as larger individuals form the major reproductive component. Between species comparisons showed active species survived to higher temperatures than sessile or low activity groups. Thus active groups (e.g. predators) and juvenile or immature individuals should fare better in rapid warming scenarios. This would be expected to produce short-term ecological imbalances in warming events. The rate of warming markedly affected temperature limits in a wide range of Antarctic marine species. Different species survived to temperatures of 8*3-17*6 degrees]C when temperatures were raised by around 1 degrees]C day.sup.-1. However they only survived to temperatures between 4*0 degrees]C and 12*3 degrees]C when temperatures were raised by around 1-2 degrees]C week.sup.-1, and temperatures of only 1*0-6*0 degrees]C were tolerated for acclimations over periods of months. Current models predicting range changes of species in response to climate change are either correlative or mechanistic. Mechanistic models offer the potential to incorporate the ecophysiological adaptation and evolutionary processes which determine future responses and go beyond simple correlative approaches. These models depend on the incorporation of data on species capacities to resist and adapt to change. This study is an important step in the provision of such data from experimental manipulations.

Operators increasingly take tourists to destinations threatened by climate change, with Antarctica and other polar regions as favourites and cruise ship and aircraft as main transport modes. The selling point is to see a destination before it disappears, a form of last chance tourism. This has been claimed to increase the environmental awareness of tourists and make them \u201cambassadors\u201d for conservation and the visited destination. Antarctic cruise ship passengers tripled from 2000 to 2007. The paper finds that high levels of greenhouse gas emissions are created by cruise ship tourists in general, and especially high levels for those visiting the Antarctic, up to approximately eight times higher per capita and per day than average international tourism trips. A survey found no evidence for the hypothesis that the trips develop greater environmental awareness, change attitudes or encourage more sustainable future travel choices. Of the Antarctic cruise passengers surveyed, 59{\\%} felt that their travel did not impact on climate change; fewer than 7{\\%} had or might offset their emissions.

The huge April 2006 loss was largely due to multiple severe storms with frequent large hail hitting major metropolitan areas. A highly unstable air mass that developed on April\u00a013 led to several supercell storms and they then produced large hailswaths across portions of Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin during a 30-h period.

While there is general agreement that a regime shift consists of a restructuring of a marine ecosystem, the form of restructuring that constitutes a regime shift remains under debate. At present, we identify regime shifts through exploratory data analysis but what types of data are appropriate and how should the data be treated. There are many different possible variables to consider in describing a marine ecosystem. There are even many different categories of variables: physical, biogeochemical, habitat, and organismal (from bacteria and plankton through zooplankton to fish). It is possible to consider hundreds or indeed thousands of variables for a given marine ecosystem. Given the complexity of regime shifts, and the potential for misidentification, the selection of the data, and the approach taken to the analysis are important. The results of the analysis of very complex data sets can be quite sensitive to the approach taken to the analysis. The first step in the analysis is a consideration of what we are looking for. In analyzing data for patterns, we need to know the characteristics of the pattern for which we are searching. With a template in hand, we can then consider the different approaches available for pattern extraction from the data. Since a regime shift is rarely identified through a single variable or time series, a common strategy is to bring together many different time series including both physical and biological data. The typical first step in the analysis is normalization of the data followed by some form of data summation or integration to reduce noise in order that the desired signal is more apparent. Most of the techniques are numerically quite straightforward, although some can be computationally demanding. While there is no unambiguous technique at present, the application of available techniques has been useful in improving our understanding of ocean regime states and shifts. No pure statistical analysis can replace our understanding of the underlying dynamical relations of the various variables, which can be enhanced by explicit dynamic modeling.", "ENTRYTYPE": "incollection", "ID": "DeYoung2009"}, {"year": "2004", "volume": "33", "url": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15387075", "title": "{Global change and the boreal forest: thresholds, shifting states or gradual change?}", "publisher": "BioOne", "pmid": "15387075", "pages": "361--365", "number": "6", "month": "aug", "keywords": "Arctic Regions,Conservation of Natural Resources,Environment,Greenhouse Effect,Policy Making,Population Dynamics,Social Conditions,Trees,Trees: growth {\\&} development", "journal": "AMBIO: A Journal of the Human Environment", "issn": "0044-7447", "file": "::", "author": "Chapin, F Stuart and Callaghan, Terry V and Bergeron, Yves and Fukuda, M and Johnstone, J F and Juday, G and Zimov, S a and {Chapin III}, F Stuart", "abstract": "Changes in boreal climate of the magnitude projected for the 21st century have always caused vegetation changes large enough to be societally important. However, the rates and patterns of vegetation change are difficult to predict. We review evidence suggesting that these vegetation changes may be gradual at the northern forest limit or where seed dispersal limits species distribution. However, forest composition may be quite resilient to climate change in the central portions of a species range until some threshold is surpassed. At this point, changes can be rapid and unexpected, often causing a switch to very different ecosystem types. Many of these triggers for change are amenable to management, suggesting that our choice of policies in the coming decades will substantially influence the ecological and societal consequences of current climatic change.", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "ChapinIII2004"}, {"volume": "57", "title": "{Distinguishing the effects of climate on discharge in a tropical river highly impacted by large dams}", "journal": "Hydrological Sciences Journal-Journal Des Sciences Hydrologiques", "issn": "0262-6667", "file": "::", "author": "Genz, F and Luz, L D", "annote": "{\\textless}m:note{\\textgreater}        {\\textless}m:bold{\\textgreater}From Duplicate 2 ( {\\textless}/m:bold{\\textgreater}        {\\textless}m:bold{\\textgreater}          {\\textless}/m:bold{\\textgreater}{\\textless}m:bold{\\textgreater}{\\textless}m:italic{\\textgreater}Distinguishing the effects of climate on discharge in a tropical river highly impacted by large dams{\\textless}/m:italic{\\textgreater}{\\textless}/m:bold{\\textgreater}{\\textless}m:bold{\\textgreater}        {\\textless}/m:bold{\\textgreater}        {\\textless}m:bold{\\textgreater} - Genz, F; Luz, L D ){\\textless}m:linebreak/{\\textgreater}        {\\textless}/m:bold{\\textgreater}        {\\textless}m:linebreak/{\\textgreater}PT: J; TC: 0; UT: WOS:000306111300013{\\textless}m:linebreak/{\\textgreater}        {\\textless}m:linebreak/{\\textgreater}      {\\textless}/m:note{\\textgreater}", "abstract": "The hydrological regime of a river is defined by variables or representative curves that in turn have characteristics related to fluctuations in flow rates resulting from climate variability.

To discriminate the alterations resulting from climate variation from those due to regulation by dams, a reference hydrological regime was established using the classification of events based on mean annual streamflow anomalies and inferred climatic conditions.
