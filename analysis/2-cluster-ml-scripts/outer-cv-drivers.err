Some layers from the model checkpoint at distilbert-base-uncased were not used when initializing TFDistilBertForSequenceClassification: ['vocab_projector', 'vocab_layer_norm', 'vocab_transform', 'activation_13']
- This IS expected if you are initializing TFDistilBertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing TFDistilBertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some layers of TFDistilBertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at distilbert-base-uncased and are newly initialized: ['dropout_19', 'pre_classifier', 'classifier']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
