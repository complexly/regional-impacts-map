      "Recurrence of Thalassia testudinum seagrass die-off in Florida Bay, USA: initial observations\n",
      "Widespread mortality of Thalassia testudinum was first documented in Florida Bay, USA, during the summer of 1987. This unprecedented event spanned 3 yr, affected 40 km(2) of sea-grass and resulted in more than a decade of ecological disturbances. Initial putative causes for seagrass die-off ranged from climatic anomalies and watershed changes to wasting disease and eutrophication. Subsequent experimental research suggested that hypoxic plant tissue, caused by low water column oxygen content or reduced photosynthesis, allowed intrusion of sulfide leading to plant death. Contributing factors included high temperatures, salinities and T. testudinum bio-mass, together causing lower oxygen water solubility, higher community respiration rates and elevated nighttime oxygen demand. The Fisheries Habitat Assessment Program (FHAP) has tracked the system's slow recovery since 1995. Recent FHAP data (2012) indicated that T. testudinum had returned to pre-die-off densities in even the most severely affected locations. During the summer of 2015, following several months of drought, National Park Service researchers reported hyper-saline conditions and a recurrence of seagrass die-off in north-central Florida Bay. An interagency effort is presently underway to document the duration, extent, impacts and possible factors responsible for the current mortality. Initial field surveys indicate that there is high spatial coincidence between the current and the 1987-1990 events and that hypersalinity, water column stratification and bottom-water anoxia might have once again resulted in mass mortality of T. testudinum in Florida Bay. The goal of this report is to alert the scientific community to the recurrence of this important ecological event.\n",

      "Indigenous Knowledge and Long-term Ecological Change: Detection, Interpretation, and Responses to Changing Ecological Conditions in Pacific Island Communities\n",
      "When local resource users detect, understand, and respond to environmental change they can more effectively manage environmental resources. This article assesses these abilities among artisanal fishers in Roviana Lagoon, Solomon Islands. In a comparison of two villages, it documents local resource users' abilities to monitor long-term ecological change occurring to seagrass meadows near their communities, their understandings of the drivers of change, and their conceptualizations of seagrass ecology. Local observations of ecological change are compared with historical aerial photography and IKONOS satellite images that show 56 years of actual changes in seagrass meadows from 1947 to 2003. Results suggest that villagers detect long-term changes in the spatial cover of rapidly expanding seagrass meadows. However, for seagrass meadows that showed no long-term expansion or contraction in spatial cover over one-third of respondents incorrectly assumed changes had occurred. Examples from a community-based management initiative designed around indigenous ecological knowledge and customary sea tenure governance show how local observations of ecological change shape marine resource use and practices which, in turn, can increase the management adaptability of indigenous or hybrid governance systems.\n",

      "An overview of Cuban seagrasses\n",
      "Here, we present an overview of the current knowledge of Cuban seagrasses, including distribution, status, threats, and efforts for their conservation. It has been estimated that seagrasses cover about 50% of the Cuban shelf, with six species reported and Thalassia testudinum K.D. Koenig being the most dominant. Seagrasses have been studied primarily in three areas in Cuba (northwest, north-central, and southwest). Thalassia testudinum and other seagrasses exhibit spatial and temporal variations in abundance, and updating of their status and distribution is needed. The main threat to Cuban seagrass ecosystems is low seawater transparency due to causes such as eutrophication and erosion. High salinities limit their distribution in the Sabana-Camaguey Archipelago, partly the result of freshwater dams and roads. Seagrass meadows play important ecological roles and provide many ecosystem services in Cuba, with efforts underway to preserve this ecosystem. Research and management projects are directed toward integrated coastal zone management, including a ban on trawl fisheries and the extension of marine protected areas to contain more seagrass meadows. In addition to updating species distributions, it is urgent that managers and researchers in Cuba examine the resilience of this ecosystem in the face of climate change.\n",
